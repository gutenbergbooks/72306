<p class='c008'>Utility, not originality, has been aimed at in the compilation
of this work. The obstacles and difficulties its author had met
with in his endeavors to learn something of the article he was
commissioned to sell when he first entered the Tea trade, the
almost total lack of knowledge displayed by the average dealer
in the commodity, allied to the numerous inquiries for a work containing
“all about tea,” first prompted the undertaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>The material was collated at intervals, in a fragmentary
manner, covering a period of over twenty years, and arranged
amid the many interruptions incident to an active business life,
subjected to constant revisions, repeated prunings and innumerable
corrections, due mainly to the varying statements and conflicting
opinions of admitted authorities in every branch of the subject.
Still, as careful and judicious an arrangement of the data has been
given as possible, a faithful effort being made to omit nothing that
may prove useful, instructive or profitable to the expert, the dealer
or general reader.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aware that many facts have been omitted, and many errors
committed in its preparation, he still trusts that the pains he has
taken to avoid both have not been in vain, that the former may be
few, and the latter of no great importance. The work was compiled
under impulse, not under inducement, a single line not being
intended originally for the market, and is now being published
solely for the benefit of those “whom it may concern.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_4 c008'>The history of Tea is intimately bound up with
that of China, that is, so far as the Western world
is concerned, its production and consumption
being for centuries confined to that country. But,
having within the past two centuries become known and
almost indispensable as an article of diet in every civilized
country of the globe, it cannot but prove interesting to
inquire into the progress, properties and effects of a commodity
which could have induced so large a portion of
mankind to abandon so many other articles of diet in its
favor, as well as the results of its present enormous consumption.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although now to be found in a wild state in the
mountain-ranges of Assam, and in a state of cultivation
through a wide range from India to Japan, the original
country of Tea is not definitely known, but from the
fact of its being in use in China from the earliest times
it is commonly attributed to that country. Yet though
claimed to have been known in China long anterior to
the Christian era, and even said to have been mentioned
in the <i>Sao-Pao</i>, published 2700 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>, and also in the <i>Rye</i>,
600 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>, the exact date or manner of its first discovery and
use in that country is still in doubt. One writer claims
that the famous herb was cultivated and classified in
China 2000 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>, almost as completely as it is to-day, and
that it was used as a means of promoting amity between
Eastern monarchs and potentates at this early period.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Chin-Nung, a celebrated scholar and philosopher, who
existed long before Confucius, is claimed to have said
of it: “Tea is better than wine, for it leadeth not to
intoxication, neither does it cause a man to say foolish
things and repent thereof in his sober moments. It is
better than water, for it doth not carry disease; neither
doth it act as a poison, as doth water when the wells
contain foul and rotten matter,” and Confucius admonishes
his followers to: “Be good and courteous to all, even
to the stranger from other lands. If he say unto thee that
he thirsteth give unto him <i>a cup of warm Tea</i> without
money and without price.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A Chinese legend ascribes its first discovery to one
Darma, a missionary, famed throughout the East for his
religious zeal, who, in order to set an example of piety
to his followers, imposed on himself various privations,
among which was that of forswearing sleep. After
some days and nights passed in this austere manner,
he was overcome and involuntarily fell into a deep
slumber, on awakening from which he was so distressed
at having violated his vow, and in order to prevent a
repetition of allowing “tired eyelids to rest on tired eyes,”
he cut off the offending portions and flung them to the
ground. On returning the next day, he discovered that
they had undergone a strange metamorphosis, becoming
changed into a shrub, the like of which had never been
seen before. Plucking some of the leaves and chewing
them he found his spirits singularly exhilarated, and his
former vigor so much restored that he immediately recommended
the newly discovered boon to his disciples.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tradition, on the other hand, never at a loss for some
marvelous story, but with more plausibility, claims that
the use of Tea was first discovered accidentally in China
by some Buddhist priests, who, unable to use the brackish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>water near their temple, steeped in it the leaves of a
shrub, growing in the vicinity, with the intention of
correcting its unpleasant properties. The experiment
was so successful that they informed the inhabitants
of their discovery, subsequently cultivating the plant
extensively for that express purpose. While another
record attributes its first discovery about 2737 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span> to
the aforementioned Chin-Nung, to whom all agricultural
and medicinal knowledge is traced in China. In replenishing
a fire made of the branches of the Tea plant, some
of the leaves fell into the vessel in which he was boiling
water for his evening meal. Upon using it he found it
to be so exciting and exhilarating in its effects that he
continued to use it; imparting the knowledge thus gained
to others, its use soon spread throughout the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>These accounts connected with the first discovery of
the Tea plant in China are purely fabulous, and it is not
until we come down to the fourth century of the Christian
era that we can trace any positive allusion to it by a
Chinese writer. But, as the early history of nearly every
other ancient discovery is more or less vitiated by fable,
we ought not to be any more fastidious or less indulgent
towards the marvelous in the discovery of Tea
than we are towards that of fire, iron, glass or coffee.
The main facts may be true, though the details be incorrect;
and, though the accidental discovery of fire
may not have been made by Suy-Jin in the manner
claimed, yet it probably was communicated originally by
the friction of two sticks. Nor may it be strictly correct
to state that Fuh-he made the accidental discovery of
iron by the burning of wood on brown earth any more
than the Phœnicians discovered the making of glass by
burning green wood on sand, yet it is not improbable
that some such accidental processes first led to these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>discoveries. Thus, also, considerable allowances are to
be deducted from the scientific discoveries of Chin-Nung
in botany, when we read of his having, in one day, discovered
no less than seventy different species of plants
that were poisonous and seventy others that were antidotes
against their baneful effects.</p>

<p class='c009'>According to some Chinese authorities, the Tea plant
was first introduced into their country from Corea as late
as the fourth century of the present era, from whence it is
said to have been carried to Japan in the ninth. Others
again maintaining that it is undoubtedly indigenous to
China, being originally discovered on the hills of those
provinces, where it now grows so abundantly, no date,
however, being named. While the Japanese, to whom
the plant is as valuable as it is to the Chinese, state that
both countries obtained it simultaneously from Corea,
about A. D. 828. This latter claim not being sustained
by any proof whatever—Von Siebold, to the contrary—who,
relying on the statements of certain Japanese writers
to this effect, argues in support of their assertions, the
improbability of which is unconsciously admitted by Von
Siebold himself when he observes “that in the southern
provinces of Japan the tea plant is abundant on the
plains, but as the traveler advances towards the mountains
it disappears,” hence inferring that it is an exotic.
The converse of this theory holding good of China, a
like inference tends to but confirm their claim that with
them the plant is indigenous. That the Japanese did
not originally obtain the plant from Corea but from
China is abundantly proven by the Japanese themselves,
many of whom admit that it was first introduced to
their country from China about the middle of the
ninth century. In support of this acknowledgment it
is interesting to note, as confirming the Chinese origin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of tea, that there is still standing at Uji, not far from
Osaka, a temple erected on what is said to have been the
first tea plantation established in Japan, sacred to the
traditions of the Japanese and in honor of the Chinese
who first introduced the tea plant into the Island empire.
Another more authentic account states that the Tea-seed
was brought to Japan from China by the Buddhist
priest Mi-yoye, about the beginning of the thirteenth
century, and first planted in the southern island of Kiusiu,
from whence its cultivation soon spread throughout
that country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some English writers go so far as to claim that Assam,
in India, is the original country of tea, from the
fact that <i>a species</i> has been discovered there in a wild
state as well as in the slopes of the Himalaya mountains.
But though found in both a wild and cultivated
state in many countries of the East at the present time,
all its Western traditions point to China, and to China
<i>only</i>, as the <i>original</i> country of Tea, and that the plant
is native and indigenous to that country is indisputably
beyond question.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not known to the Greeks or Romans in any
form; and that it could not have been known in India in
very early times is inferred from the fact that no reference
to the plant or its product is to be found in the
<i>Sanscrit</i>. But that the plant and its use, not only as an
agreeable and exhilarating beverage, but as an article of
traffic worthy of other nations, must have been known to
the Chinese as early as the first century of the Christian
era, the following extract from an ancient work entitled
the “Periplous of the <a id='tn013'></a>Erythræan Sea,” may serve to prove.
The author, usually supposed to be Arryan, after describing
“a city called Thinæ,” proceeds to narrate a yearly
mercantile journey to the vicinity of “a certain people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>called Sesatæi, of short stature, broad faces, and flat
noses”—evidently natives of China—adds “that the articles
they bring for traffic outwardly resemble vine leaves,
being wrapped in mats, which they leave behind them
on their departure to their own country in the interior.
From these mats the Thinæ pick out a haulm, called
<i>petros</i>, from which they draw the fibre and stalks; spreading
out the leaves, they double and make them up into
balls, passing the fibre through them, in which form they
take the name of <i>Malabathrum</i>, and under this name
they are brought into India by those who so prepare
them.” Under any interpretation this account sounds
like a remote, obscure and confused story. Still one of
the authors of the able “Historical Account of China,”
published in 1836, has ventured to identify this Malabathrum
of the Thinæ with the Tea of the Chinese.
Vossius Vincent and other authors, while admitting the
difficulty of understanding why it should be carried from
Arracan to China, and from China back to India, unhesitatingly
assert that Malabathrum was nothing more than
the Betel-leaf, so widely used in the East at the time as
a masticatory. Horace mentions Malabathrum, but only
as an ointment. Pliny refers to it both in that sense
and as a medicine. Dioscorides describing it as a masticatory
only. While the author of the “Historical Account”
prefers to consider the passage in the Periplous
as a very clumsy description of a process not intelligently
understood by the describer, but as agreeing far
better with the manipulation of Tea than with that of
the Betel-leaf, and his conjecture, unsupported as it is,
merits citation if only for its originality.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first positive reference to Tea is that by Kieu-lung
in the fourth century, who not only describes the
plant, but also the process of preparing it, of which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>following is a free and condensed translation: “On a slow
fire set a tripod, whose color and texture show its long
use, and fill it with clear snow-water. Boil it as long as
would be sufficient to turn cray-fish red, and throw it
upon the delicate leaves of choice Tea. Let it remain as
long as the vapor arises in a cloud and only a thin mist
floats on the surface. Then at your ease drink the precious
liquor so prepared, which will chase away the five
causes of sorrow. You can taste and feel, but not describe
the state of repose produced by a beverage thus
prepared.” It is again mentioned by Lo-yu, a learned
Chinese, who lived during the dynasty of Tang, in 618,
who became quite enthusiastic in its praise, claiming that
“It tempers the spirits, harmonizes the mind, dispels lassitude
and relieves fatigue, awakens thought and clears
the perceptive faculties,” and according to the <i>Kiang-moo</i>,
an historical epitome, an impost duty was levied
on Tea as early as 782 by the Emperor Te-Tsing, and
continued to the present day.</p>

<p class='c009'>McPherson, in his “History of European Commerce
with India,” states that Tea is mentioned as the usual
beverage of the Chinese by Solieman, an Arabian merchant,
who wrote an account of his travels in the East
about the year 850. By the close of the ninth century,
however, Tea was found in general use among the Chinese,
the tax upon it at that time being a source of considerable
revenue as recorded by Abuzeid-el-Hazen, an
Arabian traveler cited by Renaudot in a translation of
his work. There is also independent evidence furnished
by two other Arabian travelers in a narrative of their
wanderings during the latter half of the ninth century,
admitting their statements to be trustworthy as to the
general use of Tea as a beverage among the Chinese at
that period. Moorish travelers appear to have introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>it into Mohammedan countries early in the tenth
century, and other travelers in China in the seventeenth
give most extravagant accounts of its virtues, which appears
to have been in very general use throughout the
greater part of Asia at that time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Father de Rhodes, a Jesuit missionary, who entered
China in 1633, states that “the use of Tea is common
throughout the East, <i>and begins, I perceive, to be known
in Europe</i>. It is in all the world to be found only in two
provinces of China, where the gathering of it occupies
the people as the vintage does us.” Adding that he
found it in his own case to be an instantaneous remedy
for headache, and when compelled to sit up all night to
hear confessions its use saved him from drowsiness and
fatigue. Adam Olearius, describing the travels of an
embassy to Persia in 1631, says of the Persians: “They
are great frequenters of taverns, called Tzai Chattai, where
they drink Thea or Cha, which the Tartars bring from
China, and to which they assign extravagant qualities,
imagining that it alone will keep a man in perfect health,
and are sure to treat all who visit them to this drink at
all hours.” These strong expressions as to the use of
Tea, applying as they do to a period not later than 1640,
are sufficient to prove that the ordinary accounts place
the introduction of that beverage as regards Europe,
particularly the Continent, as too late.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>INTRODUCTION INTO EUROPE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The earliest European notice of Tea is that found in
a work by Ramusio, first printed in 1550, though written
several years prior to that year. In it he quotes Hazzi
Mohamed in effect, “And these people of Cathay (China)
do say that if these in our parts of the world only knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of Tea, there is no doubt that our merchants would
cease altogether to use <i>Ravino Cini</i>, as they call rhubarb.”
Yet no accounts at present accessible establish
the date of its first introduction into Europe, and it
is also a difficult matter to determine to which of the
two nations—Portugal or Holland—the credit of first
introducing it belongs. Some writers claiming that
the Dutch East India Company brought Tea to Amsterdam
in 1600, while the Portuguese claim the honor
of its first introduction prior to that year. An indisputable
argument in favor of the latter is the notice
given of it by Giovani Maffei in his “History of India,”
published in 1559. “The inhabitants of China, like those
of Japan,” he writes, “extract from an herb called <i>Chia</i>
a beverage which they drink warm, and which is extremely
wholesome, being a remedy against phlegm,
languor and a promoter of longevity.” While Giovani
Botero, another Portuguese, in a work published in the
same year, states that “the Chinese have an herb from
which they press a delicate juice, which they use instead
of wine, finding it to be a preservative against these diseases
which are produced by the use of wine amongst
us.” Taxiera, also a native of Portugal, states that he
saw the dried leaves of Tea at Malacca some years
prior to 1600, and the article is also mentioned in one
of the earliest privileges accorded to the Portuguese for
trading in 1558; yet it was not until nearly a century
from the beginning of that trade that we find the first
distinct account from a European pen of the use of Tea
as a beverage.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a “Dissertation upon Tea, by Thomas Short,”
printed in London, in 1730, the author gives the following
account of its first introduction into Europe: “The
Dutch East India Company on their second voyage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>to China carried thither a good store of Sage and exchanged
it with the Chinese for Tea, receiving three to
four pounds of the last for one pound of the first, by
calling it a wonderful European herb possessed of as
many virtues as the Indians could ascribe to their shrub-leaf.
But because they exported not such large quantities
of Sage as they imported of Tea they also bought
a great deal of the latter, giving eight- to tenpence a
pound for it in China. And when they first brought
it to Paris they sold it for thirty livres the pound; but
thirty years ago the Chinese sold it at threepence, and
never above ninepence a pound at any time, frequently
mixing it with other herbs to increase the quantity.”
Macaulay also states in the history of his embassy to
China that “early in the seventeenth century some
Dutch adventurers, seeking for such objects as might
fetch a price in China, and hearing of a general use
there of a beverage produced from a plant of the country,
bethought themselves of trying how far a European
plant of supposed great virtues might also be appreciated
by the Chinese; they accordingly introduced to
them the herb Sage, the Dutch accepting in exchange
the Chinese Tea, which they brought back with them
to Holland.” These statements but tend to confirm
the Portuguese claim, the efforts of the Dutch to open
up trade with the Chinese in Tea being evidently made
many years subsequent to its introduction by the former;
in still further support of which the following may be
noted:—</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1662 <span class='sc'>Charles II.</span> married the Portuguese princess,
Catharine of Braganza, who, it is said, was very fond of
Tea, having been accustomed to it in her own country.
Waller, in a poem celebrating the event, ascribes its first
introduction to her country in the appended lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“Venus her myrtle has—Phœbus her bays;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Tea both excels, which she vouchsafes to praise.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The best of Queens and <i>best of herbs we owe</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'>To that proud nation which the way did show.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The earliest mention made of Tea by an Englishman
is that contained in a letter from a Mr. Wickham, agent
of the East India Company at Firando, Japan, and dated
June 27, 1615, to a Mr. Eaton, another officer of the
Company, resident at Macao, China, asking for “a pot
of the best Cha.” How the commission was executed
does not appear, but in Mr. Eaton’s subsequent account
of expenditures occurs this item, “Three silver porringers
to drink Tea in.” The first person, however,
to advocate the use of Tea in Europe was Cornelius
Bottrekoe, a professor of the Leyden University, who,
in a treatise on “Tea, Coffee and Chocolate,” published
in 1649, strongly pronounces in favor of the former,
denying the possibility of its being injurious even when
taken in immoderate quantities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea was evidently known in England previous to its
direct importation there, small quantities having been
brought from Holland as early as 1640, but used only
on rare occasions. The earliest mention made of it,
however, is that contained in a copy of the “<i>Mercurius
Politicus</i>,” at present in the British Museum, and dated
September, 1658, in which attention is called to “that
excellent, and by all Physitians approved, China drink,
called by the Chineans Tcha, by other nations Tay, sold
at the Sultaness Head, a Cophee-house by the Royal
Exchange, London.” The most famous house for Tea
at this early period, however, was Garway’s, more popularly
known for upwards of two centuries as “Garraway’s,”
being swept away only a few years ago by the
march of improvement. Defoe refers to it as being “frequented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>only by people of quality, who had business
in the city and the wealthier citizens”; but later it became
the resort of speculators, and here it was that the
numerous schemes which surrounded and accompanied
the “Great South Sea Bubble” had their centre, and,
appropriately enough, “Garraway’s” was also the headquarters
of that most remarkable but disastrous Tea
speculation of 1842.</p>

<p class='c009'>A singular handbill issued by its founder is still extant,
being discovered by accident in a volume of pamphlets
found in the British Museum, where it may still be
inspected. Although the document bears no date, there
is ample internal evidence to prove that it must have
been printed about 1660. It is a quaint and extraordinary
production, purporting to be “An exact description
of the leaf Tea, made according to the directions
of the most knowing merchants and travelers in those
Eastern countries, by Thomas Garway,” setting forth
that:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Tea is generally brought from China, growing there on little
shrubs, the branches whereof are garnished with white flowers of
the bigness and fashion of sweetbriar, but smell unlike, and bearing
green leaves of the bigness of myrtle or sumac, which leaves
are gathered every day, the best being gathered by virgins who
are destined for the work, the said leaves being of such known
virtues that those nations famous for antiquity, knowledge and
wisdom do frequently sell it among themselves for twice its
weight in silver. That it hath been used only as a regalia in
high treatments and entertainments, presents being made thereof
to grandees.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Proceeding at considerable length to enumerate its
“virtues,” many of which are decidedly apocryphal, and
attributing to the beverage, among its other properties,
that of—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Making the body active and lusty, helping the headache,
giddiness and heaviness, removing the difficulty of breathing,
clearing the sight, banishing lassitude, strengthening the stomach,
causing good appetite and digestion, vanishing heavy dreams,
easing the frame, strengthening the memory, and finally preventing
consumption, particularly when drank with milk.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Many other remarkable properties being credited to
this wonderful “Chinese herb,” the advertiser closes his
great encomiums by suggesting—</p>

<p class='c017'>“That all persons of eminence and quality, gentlemen, and
others who have occasion for tea in the leaf may be supplied.
These are to give notice that the said Thomas hath the same to
sell from sixteen to fifty shillings the pound.”</p>

<p class='c015'>If the article had possessed but a tithe of the virtues
and excellencies accorded to it by the celebrated Garway
it must have been recognized at the time as the coming
boon to man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to 1660 no mention is made of Tea in the English
statute books, although it is cited in an act of the first
parliament of the Restoration of the same year, which
imposed a tax of “eightpence on every <i>gallon</i> made and
sold, to be paid by the maker thereof.” This was subsequently
increased to five shillings per pound in the
Leaf, which at the time was stated to be “no small prejudice
to the article, as well as an inconvenience to the
drinker.” Ever since that year the duty on Tea has
been one of the hereditary customs of the Crown,
though Parliament has at sundry times, by different acts,
fixed divers duties upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pepys alludes to Tea in his Diary, under date of September
25, 1661, the entry reading: “I did send for a cup
of Tee, a China drink, of which I never drank before”;
and again, in 1667, he further mentions it. “Home, and
there find my wife making of Tee, a drink which Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Pelling, the Potticary, says is good for her cold.” But
that it still must have continued rare, is very evident, as
in 1664, it is recorded that the East India Company made
the king what was then considered “a brilliant present
of 2 lbs. of Tea, costing forty shillings,” and two years
later another present of 22 lbs., both parcels being purchased
on the Continent for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not until 1668 that the East India Company is
credited with the direct importation of Tea into England,
which, although chartered in 1600, for the first time considered
Tea worthy their attention as an article of trade.
The order sent to their agents in that year was: “for
100 lbs. of the best <i>Tey</i> they could procure to the
amount of £25 sterling.” Their instructions must, however,
have been considerably exceeded, as the quantity
received was 4,713 lbs., a supply which seems to have
“glutted the market” for several years after. Up to this
time no alarm had been excited that the use of Tea was
putting in peril the stalwarthood of the British race.
But in the very year of this large importation we find
Saville writing to his uncle Coventry, in sharp reproof
of certain friends of his “who call for Tea, instead of
pipes and wine,” stigmatizing its use as “a base, unworthy
Indian practice,” and adding, with an audible
sigh, “the truth is, all nations are getting so wicked as
to have some of those filthy customs.” Whether from
sympathy of the public with these indignant reprehensions
or other causes, the whole recorded imports for the
six following years amounted to only 410 lbs., the quantities
imported continuing small and consisting exclusively
of the finer sorts for several years thereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first considerable shipment of tea reached London
about 1695, from which year the imports steadily and
rapidly increased until the end of the seventeenth century,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>when the annual importations averaged 20,000
pounds. In 1703 orders were sent from England to
China for 85,000 pounds of Green Tea and 25,000 pounds
of Black, the average price at this period ranging from
16 to 20 shillings ($4 to $5) per pound. The Company’s
official account of their trade did not commence before
1725, but according to Milburn’s “Oriental Commerce”
the consumption in the year 1711 had increased to upwards
of 142 million pounds, in 1711 to 121 millions,
and in 1720 to 238 million pounds. Since which time
there has been nothing in the history of commerce so
remarkable as the growth and development of the trade
in Tea, becoming, as it has, one of the most important
articles of foreign production consumed.</p>

<p class='c009'>For above a century and a half the sole object of the
English East India Company’s trade with China was to
furnish Tea for consumption in England, the Company
during that period enjoying a monopoly of the Tea
trade to the exclusion of all other parties. They were
bound, however, “to send orders for Tea from time to
time, provide ships for its transportation, and always to
keep at least one year’s supply in their warehouses,”
being also compelled to “bring all Teas to London, and
there offer them at public sale quarterly, and to dispose
of them at one penny per pound advance on the gross
cost of importation, the price being determined by adding
their prime cost in China to the expenses of freight,
insurance, interest on capital invested, and other charges.”
But in December, 1680, Thomas Eagle of the “King’s
Head,” a noted coffee-house in St. James, inserted in the
<i>London Gazette</i> the following advertisement, which shows
that Tea continued to be imported independently of the
East India Company: “These are to give notice to persons
of quality that a small parcel of most excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Tea has, by accident, fallen into the hands of a private
person to be sold. But that none may be disappointed,
the lowest price is 30 shillings in the pound, and not any
to be sold under a pound in weight.” The persons of
quality were also requested to bring a convenient box
with them to hold it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The East India Company enjoyed a monopoly of the
trade in Tea up to 1834, when, owing to the methods of
calculation adopted by the Company, and the heavier expenses
which always attend every department of a trade
monopoly, the prices were greatly enhanced. Much dissatisfaction
prevailing with its management, this system
of importing Teas was abolished, the Company being
deprived of its exclusive privileges, and the Tea trade
thrown open to all.</p>

<p class='c009'>In all probability Tea first reached America from
England, which country began to export in 1711, but
it is claimed to have been previously introduced by some
Dutch smugglers, no definite date being given. The first
American ship sailed for China in 1784, two more vessels
being dispatched the following year, bringing back
880,000 pounds of Tea. During 1786-87, five other
ships brought to the United States over 1,000,000
pounds. In 1844, the “Howqua” and “Montauk”
were built expressly for the Tea trade, being the first
of the class of vessels known as “Clippers,” in which
speed was sought at the expense of carrying capacity,
and by which the average passage was reduced from
twenty to thirty days for the round trip. The trade in
tea was entirely transacted at Canton until 1842, when the
ports of Shanghai, Amoy and <a id='tn024'></a>Foochow were opened by
the treaty of Nankin, the China tea trade being mainly
conducted at the latter ports. As late as 1850, all vessels
trading in tea carried considerable armament, a necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>precaution against the pirates who swarmed in the China
seas during the first half of the last century.</p>

<p class='c009'>The progress of this famous plant has been something
like the progress of Truth, suspected at first, though
very palatable to those who had the courage to taste it,
resisted as it encroached, and abused as its use spread,
but establishing its triumph at last in cheering the
world, from palace to cottage, by the resistless effect of
time and its own virtues only; becoming a beverage
appreciated by all, as well as an agent of progress and
civilization.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>TEA<br><span class='small'>AND</span><br>AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Although Tea may be claimed to be in all its associations
eminently peaceful, growing as it does on the hill-sides
of one of the most peaceful countries in the world,
coming to us through the peace-promoting ways of commerce,
until it reaches its ultimate destination, that centre
of peace—the family table—and like peaceful sleep,
“knitting up the raveled sleeve of care,” yet it has been
the occasion of several wars and political problems, the
latest of which is the precipitation of the great Chinese
exodus, which at present threatens such vital results,
not only to our own country, but possibly to the world
at large.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was destined—as in all social and political affairs,
the greatest and most important events are curiously
linked with the smallest and most insignificant—to be
the final crisis of the American Revolutionary movement.
Think of it! <i>The birth of the greatest nation of all time
due to a three-penny tax on tea!</i> It was the article
chosen above all others to emphasize the principles that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“<i>all men are born free and equal</i>,” and that “<i>taxation
without representation is tyranny</i>,” and for the establishment
of which principles a war was fought, that when
judged by the law of results, proves to have been the
most important and fruitful recorded on history’s pages.
Who, in looking back over the long range of events
conserving to create our now great country, can fail to
have his attention attracted to what has been termed,
with a characteristic touch of American humor, “The
Boston Tea Party of 1773”? Who could have then
predicted the marvelous change that a single century
of free government would have wrought? Who could
have dreamed that Tea would have proved such an important
factor in such a grand result? What a lesson to
despotic governments! A dreary November evening; a
pier crowded with excited citizens; a few ships in the
harbor bearing a hated cargo—hated not of itself, but for
the principles involved; on the decks a mere handful of
young men—a few leaders in Israel—urged on by the
fiery prescience of genius, constituting themselves an advance
guard to lead the people from out the labyrinth of
Remonstrance into the wilderness of Revolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is true that previously other questions had been factors
in the dispute, but a cursory glance at the history of
the time will show that heated debates had been followed
by periods of rest, and acts of violence by renewed loyalty.
The “Navigation laws” had caused much indignation
and many protests, but no violence to mention. As
early as 1768 the famous “Stamp Act” was passed and
repealed. The period intervening between its passage
and repeal gave opportunity for public opinion to crystallize
and shape itself. It sifted out of the people a modern
Demosthenes, gifted with the divine power of draping
the graceful garment of language round the firm body of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>an <span class='fss'>IDEA</span>! George III. would not profit by the example
of Cæsar or of Charles, and while North had avowed
his willingness to repeal the tax on all other articles, he
promised the king that “<i>he would maintain this one tax
on Tea to prove to the Colonists his right to tax</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The trade in Tea at this time was a monopoly of the
English East India Company, which just then had acquired
an immense political prestige, but lost heavily
by the closing of the American market, the Company’s
warehouses in London remaining full of it, causing their
revenue to decline. North was induced to offer them a
measure of relief by releasing from taxation in England
the Tea intended for America, but he still persisted in
maintaining the duty of threepence to be paid in American
ports, and on the 10th of May this farcical scheme
of fiscal readjustment became a law. The Company
obtained a license for the free-duty exportation of their
Tea to America in disregard of the advice of those who
knew that the Colonists would not receive it. Four ships
laden with Tea were despatched to the ports of Boston,
New York, Philadelphia and Charleston. The Colonists
prepared for their expected arrival, public meetings
being held in Philadelphia and Boston, at which it was
resolved that <i>the Tea should be sent back to England</i>,
and so notified the Company’s agents at these ports.
The Boston consignees refused to comply with the popular
demand, all persuasion failing to move them. The
matter was then referred to the Committees, who immediately
resolved to use force where reason was not
heeded. When the vessels arrived, a meeting was held
in the Old South Church, at which it was resolved, “<i>come
what will, the Tea should not be landed or the duty paid</i>.”
Another appeal was made to the Governor, which was
also denied! Upon this announcement Samuel Adams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>arose, saying, “<i>This meeting can do nothing more to
save the country</i>.” The utterance of these words was a
preconcerted signal; the response, an Indian war-whoop
from the crowd outside. A band of young men,
not over fifty, disguised as, and styling themselves,
“Mohawks,” rushed down to the wharf where the
vessels lay; the ships were boarded, the Tea chests
broken open and emptied into the river. <i>From the
moment that the first Tea-leaf touched the water the whole
atmosphere surrounding the issues involved changed! In
that instant, with the rapidity of thought, the Colonies
vanished and America arose!</i></p>

<p class='c009'>When the news of these proceedings reached England,
it provoked a storm of anger, not only among the adherents
of the government, but also among the mercantile
and manufacturing classes, they having suffered heavy
losses by the stoppage of trade with America. The
commercial importance and parliamentary influence of
the East India Company swelled the outcry of indignation
against which they termed the outrage of destroying
its property. All united in the resolve to punish the
conduct of Boston for its rejection of the least onerous
one of an import duty on tea. What followed has been
told in song and story—Lexington and Concord, Bunker
Hill, Valley Forge and Yorktown. A new nation sprang
into existence, taking its stand upon the pedestal of
“<span class='fss'>EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL</span>,” under a new government
“<span class='fss'>OF THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE</span>.”</p>

<hr class='c007'>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c008'>Besides the character of the different varieties of
tea and other information connected with the
plant and its product, we have to notice the different
parts of the world in which it is now or
may be grown in the future, as many practical questions
of considerable importance are dependent on the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>For upwards of two centuries and a half the world’s
supply of tea was furnished exclusively by China, and it
was not until well into the middle of the nineteenth century
that China and Japan were the only two tea-producing
countries in the world, their product reaching the
western markets through the narrowest channels and
under the most oppressive restrictions. Its cultivation
however, has in that time been extended to other countries,
most notably into Java, India and Ceylon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea is more or less cultivated for local consumption in
all the provinces of China, except the extreme northern.
But to what exact degree of latitude it is difficult to be
precise, as we are without definite information from those
regions, and the vast empire of China not being sufficiently
explored by botanists to warrant the assertion that
the plant is not to be found in other parts of the country,
at least in a wild state. So far, however, it has not been
discovered there, except in a state of cultivation, or as
having evidently escaped from cultivation on roadsides
or other out-of-the-way places.</p>

<p class='c009'>We know that it is cultivated in Tonquin and Yunnan,
but only to a limited extent, the product of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>provinces being also of a very inferior quality. It is
grown in Cochin-China and the mountain ranges of Ava,
but only for local consumption, and that, while it is indigenous
to the mountains, separating China from Burmah,
it is not cultivated there for either export or profit, and
although claimed by some authorities to be grown all over
the Chinese empire, its cultivation for commercial purposes
is confined to the region lying between the 24th and
35th degrees of north latitude, the climate between these
parallels varying to a considerable extent, being much
warmer in the southern than in the northern provinces.
The districts in which it is chiefly cultivated, however,
and from which it is principally exported, are embraced
in the southwestern provinces of Che-kiang, Fo-kien,
Kiang-see, Kiang-nan, Gan-hwuy Kwang-tung, some little
being also produced for export in the western province
of Sze-chuan.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is cultivated for commercial purposes all over the
Japanese islands, from <a id='tn030a'></a>Kiusiu, in the south, to Niphon,
in the extreme north, but the zone found most favorable
to its most profitable production in these islands is that
lying between the 30th and 35th degrees, more especially
in the coast provinces of the interior sea. It is also
grown to some extent in Corea, from which country—although
claimed by some to be the original country of
tea—none is ever exported.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the year 1826 some tea seeds were sent from Japan
to Java and planted as an experiment in the residency of
<a id='tn030b'></a>Buitenzorg, where they were found to succeed so well
that tea-culture was immediately commenced on an
extensive scale in the adjoining residencies of Cheribon,
Preanger and Krawang, the number of tea trees in the
former district amounting to over 50,000 in 1833. The
several other districts of the island to which it had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>extended, now containing upwards of 20,000,000 trees
from which over 20,000,000 pounds of prepared tea are
annually delivered to commerce, tea-culture forming one
of the chief industries of the island at the present day.</p>

<p class='c009'>A species of the tea plant has been found growing in
a truly wild state in the mountain ranges of Hindostan,
particularly on those bordering on the Chinese province
of Yunnan, from which fact it is claimed by some writers
as probable that these mountains are the original home
of tea. Recent explorations also show that the tea plant
is to be found growing wild in the forests of Assam,
Sylhet and the Himalaya hills, as well as over the great
range of mountains extending thence through China to
the Yang-tse river. At an early period the British East
India Company, as the principal trade intermediary between
China and Europe, became deeply interested in the
question of tea cultivation in their eastern possessions, but
without much success until in 1840, when the Assam Tea
Company was formed, from which year the successful
cultivation of tea in India has been carried on, the tea
districts of that country including at the present time, in
the order of their priority, Assam, Dehradun, Kumaon,
Darjeeling, Cachar, Kangra, Hazarila, Chittagong, Burmah,
<a id='tn031'></a>Neilgherry and Travancore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Various efforts were made to introduce tea-culture into
Ceylon, under both Dutch and British rule, no permanent
success being attained until about 1876, when the disastrous
effects of the coffee-leaf disease induced the
planters to give more serious attention to tea. Since
that period tea cultivation has developed there with
marvelous rapidity, having every prospect at the present
time of taking first rank among Ceylon productions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Abel highly recommends the Cape of Good Hope
as furnishing a fitting soil and climate for the beneficial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>production of tea, stating that “there is nothing improbable
in a plant that is so widely diffused from north to
south being grown there.” Tea of average quality being
now shipped from Natal to the London market.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides Java, India and Ceylon, where tea culture has
been introduced and profitably demonstrated, numerous
attempts have and are being made to colonize the plant
in other countries than these of the East, but beyond the
countries above enumerated, the industry has so far never
taken root, for while the cultivated varieties of the tea-plant
are comparatively hardy, possessing an adaptability
to climate excelled alone among plants only by that
of wheat, the limits of actual tea cultivation extend from
the 39th degree of north latitude in Japan, through the
tropics to Java, Ceylon, India and China, and while it
will live in the open air in many of the countries into
which it has been introduced and withstand some amount
of frost when it receives sufficient summer heat to harden
its root, but comparatively few of those regions are suited
for practical tea-growing.</p>

<p class='c009'>As far back as 1872, some tea plants were sent from
China to the Kew gardens in England, for the purpose
of testing the possibility of its growth in that country.
The attempt, however, ended in failure, the seeds never
germinating, later efforts under more careful training
meeting with the same fate. Considerable success
attended its introduction into the islands of Bourbon and
Mauritius, in 1844, the tea produced being pronounced
as “excellent in flavor, but lacking in that strength and
aroma so characteristic of the Chinese variety.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Its cultivation has been recently attempted in the
Philippines by the Spanish, in Sumatra and Borneo
by the Dutch, and by the French in Cochin-China,
nearly all of which experiments so far proving failures,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the only success reported being from the latter country,
where the soil is good and moisture equable. Tea
plantations have also been lately opened up in Malay,
Singapore, and other of the Straits settlements by the
English; some teas of fair quality, but insufficient quantity,
having already produced in many of them. Its
cultivation forms one of the industries of the Fiji islands
at the present time; the soil and climate of the latter
being found eminently adapted to its successful propagation,
land and labor, the chief difficulties in other
countries, being particularly available there. Extraordinary
efforts are now also being made to introduce the
plant into the warmer parts of Australia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some ten years ago specimens of the Chinese tea-plant
were introduced into the Azores, where they soon
became acclimated, expert Chinese tea-makers being sent
there specially a few years later to teach the natives how
to manipulate the leaves. The industry has made such
rapid progress there that regular shipments of “Madeira
tea” are now being made to the London market, where
it is affirmed that in strength and flavor it closely approaches
that of China tea. But while it has been found
to flourish luxuriantly on the hilly parts of St. Helena,
the quantity and quality are insufficient to justify its cultivation
for either profit or export on that island.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Economic Society of St. Petersburg warmly
advocates its cultivation in the Caucasus, while French
and German naturalists declare that there is no region
more suitable for the profitable cultivation of tea than the
shores of the Black Sea, the climate being warm, moist
and equable, and tea of more than average quality have
already been produced between Batoum and Kiel,
samples of which were exhibited at the exhibition
recently held in Tiflis, the report on which was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>encouraging that the society ventures the opinion “that
in time Russia may compete with China and India in
supplying the Western nations with tea.” Efforts are
also being made to introduce it into southern Italy, but
while the soil and climate of those countries may be
found admirably adapted for the purpose, there is no
skilled labor to prepare it properly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cultivation of tea was attempted in the warmer
parts of Brazil in 1850, some tea of very fair quality being
produced in the vicinity of Rio Janeiro, and while the
plant was found to flourish exceedingly well in the
adjoining <a id='tn034'></a>province of Sao Paolo, the tea when prepared for
use was found to be entirely too bitter and astringent for
practical purposes. The lack of skilled labor and high
cost of manufacture preventing its cultivation for profit,
it was inferred that with everything else in its favor, tea
as produced in Brazil would never be able to compete
with that of China even for home consumption.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some few years since plantations were opened for the
cultivation of tea in Mexico, Guatemala, and in some of
the West India islands, but to the present no reports favorable
or otherwise, have been received regarding its progress
in these countries. Still, in the face of all drawbacks,
with the example of the many failures and final
success achieved in India and Ceylon, much may yet be
accomplished in Brazil and other South American countries
by intelligent cultivation, modern machinery and
perseverance in solving the problem of growing at least
their own tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>With regard to the efforts to introduce the tea-plant
into the United States, the earliest notice which comes
under observation is that contained in the <i>Southern
Agriculturist</i>, published in 1828, and in which it is stated
that “the tea-tree grows perfectly in the open air near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Charleston, where it has been raised for the past fifteen
years, in the nursery of M. Noisette. But as imported
from China it would cost too much to prepare for commercial
use.” Another historical effort was that made in
1848, by Dr. James Smith, at Greenville, S. C., but
although commenced with great enthusiasm the plantation
never was increased to any appreciable extent. Neither
was it brought to a condition, as far as can be ascertained,
to warrant the formation of any reliable opinion as to the
practicability of tea-culture in this country as an industry.
Nevertheless, the circumstances of its failure are
quoted as a proof that tea cannot be produced for commercial
purposes or even for home consumption in this
country. While the truth is that as a test for the purposes
named, the attempt was of no value whatever, and
never was so considered by those conversant with its
cultivation or management.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while the plant barely survives the winter north of
Washington, it has been found to thrive successfully a
little south of that district. It bears fruit abundantly
on the Pacific coast, where the soil and climate are
especially favorable to the growth of broad-leaved evergreens,
both native and exotic, and will flourish much
further north there than in the Eastern states.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still the progress of these efforts to grow tea in other
countries than China, Japan and India, must necessarily
prove interesting as being calculated to make the world
more independent of these countries for its supplies.
Yet it is an established fact that the finest varieties of
tea are best cultivated in the warmer latitudes and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>sites most exposed to air and sunshine.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c007'>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_4 c008'>There are few subjects in the vegetable kingdom
that have attracted such a large share of public
notice as the tea plant. Much error for a long
time existed regarding its botanical classification,
owing to the jealousy of the Chinese government preventing
foreigners from visiting the districts where tea
was cultivated; while the information derived from the
Chinese merchants at the shipping ports, scanty as it
was, could not be depended on with any certainty. So
that before proceeding to discuss the question of the
species which yield the teas of commerce it may be well
to notice those which are usually described as distinct
varieties in systematic works.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea is differently named in the various provinces of
China where it is grown. In some it is called <i>Tcha</i> or
<i><a id='tn037ab'></a>Cha</i>, in others <i>Tha</i> or <i>Thea</i>, in Canton <i>Tscha</i>, and finally
<i>Tia</i> by the inhabitants of Fo-kien, from whom the first
cargoes are said to have been obtained, and so pronounced
in their <i>patois</i> as to give rise to the European
name <span class='sc'>Tea</span>. By botanists it is termed <i>Thea</i>, this last
name being adopted by Linnæus for the sake of its
Greek orthography, being exactly that of <i>Oex</i>—a goddess—a
coincidence doubtless quite acceptable to those who
use and enjoy the beverage as it deserves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The species of the genus <i>Thea</i> are few in number,
some botanists being of opinion that even these are of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>single kind—<i>Camillia</i>—and is by them classed as <i>Thea-Camillia</i>.
Others asserting that no relation whatever
exists between these two plants, maintaining that the <i>Thea</i>
and <i>Camillia</i> are widely different and of a distinct
species. Yet, though the <i>Camillia</i> bears the same name
among the Chinese as <i>Thea</i> and possesses many of its
structural characteristics, distinctions are made between
them by many eminent botanists, who hold that they
differ widely and materially and are mostly agreed in
the statement that the true Tea-plant is distinguished
from the Camillia in having longer, narrower, thinner,
more serrated and less shiny leaves, and that a marked
difference is also noticeable in the form and contents of
the fruit or pod.</p>

<p class='c009'>Davis argues that they constitute two <i>genera</i>, closely
allied but yet different, the distinctions consisting principally
in the fruit or seed. The seed-vessel of the <i>Thea</i>
being a three-lobed capsule, with the lobes strongly
marked, each the size of a currant, containing only
a single round seed, the lobes bursting vertically in
the middle when ripe, exposing the seed. The capsule
of the <i>Camillia</i> is triangular in shape, much larger in
size, and though three-celled is but single-seeded. Bentham
and Hooker, who have thoroughly revised the
“<i>genera plantatum</i>,” say they can find no good reason
by which they can separate the Tea-plant as a genus distinct
from the Camillia, and so class it as <i>Thea-Camillia</i>.
While Cambesedes contends that they are widely separated
by several intervening genera, the difference being
entirely in the form of the fruit or pod; and Griffin, who
is well qualified to form a correct opinion, states that,
from an examination of the India Tea-plant and two
species of the Camillia taken from the Kyosa hills, he
found no difference whatever. The dehiscence in both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>plants is of the same nature, the only noticeable difference
really existing being of a simply specific value. The
fruit of the Tea-shrub is three-celled and three-seeded
while that of the Camillia is triangular in form and
single-seeded only.</p>

<p class='c009'>Linnæus, while recognizing the Tea-plant as belonging
to the same family as the Camillia, Latinizes its Chinese
name, classing it as <i>Thea Sinensis</i>, and dividing it into
two species—<i>Thea Viridis</i> and <i>Thea Bohea</i>; DeCandolle,
while indorsing Linnæus’ classification, adds that “in
the eighteenth century when the shrub which produces
tea was little known Linnæus named the genus Thea
Sinensis, but later judged it better to distinguish two
species which he believed at the time to correspond with
the distinctions existing between the Green and Black teas
of commerce.” The latest works on botany, also, make
Thea a distinct genus—<i>Thea Sinensis</i>—divided into two
species—<i>Thea <a id='tn039ab'></a>Viridis</i> and <i>Thea Bohea</i>—these botanical
terms having no specific relation to the varieties known to
commerce as Green and Black teas. It having also been
proven that there is but one species comprehending both
varieties, the difference in color and character being due
to a variation in the soil, climate, as well as to different
methods of cultivation and curing, from either or both
of which Green or Black tea may be prepared at will
according to the process of manufacture.</p>

and numerous leafy branches. The leaves are alternate,
large, elliptical and obtusely serrated, varied and placed in

<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and divided into five segments. The flowers are white,

yellow and tre-foil, the capsule three-celled and three-seeded;
and like all other plants in a state of cultivation,
it has produced marked varieties, two of which <i>Thea

and coriaceous, but evenly serrated and dark-green in
color. The flowers or blossoms are usually two to three,
situated at the axils, having from five to seven sepals and
petals, and possessing a slight fragrance. It is more
tender and prolific than the green variety, not standing
near as cold a climate, and yields the Black teas of
commerce principally.</p>

<p class='c009'>Considerable mystery and confusion for a long time
existed regarding the species yielding the varieties known
to commerce as Green and Black teas, many authorities
claiming that the former were produced from the green
tea-plant exclusively, and the latter solely from the black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>tea variety. While, again, it was erroneously held by
others that both were prepared at will from a single
species, the difference in color, flavor and effect was due
entirely to a disparity in soil, climate, age and process of
curing; also, that Green teas were produced from plants
cultivated on the plains or low lands, in a soil enriched
with manure, and Black teas from those grown on hill
sides and mountain slopes. Later and more careful
investigation disprove these “opinions,” the eminent
botanical traveler, Robert Fortune, having satisfactorily
and definitely set this much-vexed question at rest by
examining the subject on the spot, finding that in the
district of Woo-e-shan, where <i>Black teas are principally
prepared</i>, the species <i>Bohea</i> only is grown; and that in
the province of <a id='tn043'></a>Che-kiang, where <i>Green teas are exclusively
prepared</i>, he found the species <i>Viridis</i> alone cultivated.
But that the Green and Black teas of commerce
may be produced at will from either or both species he
found to be the case in the province of Fo-kien, where
the black tea-plant only is grown, but that both the
commercial varieties were prepared therefrom at the
pleasure of the manufacturer and according to the
demand. Yet while it is admitted now even by the
Chinese themselves, that both varieties may be prepared
at will from either species, it is a popular error to imagine
that China produces the two commercial kinds in all
districts, the preparation of the greater proportion of the
respective varieties being carried on in widely separated
districts of the empire, and from the corresponding
species of the tea-plant, different methods being pursued
in the process of curing; from the first stage, Green teas
being only distinguished from Black in such instances by
the fact that, the former are not fermented or torrified as
high by excessive heat, or fired as often as the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>It was also a commonly received opinion at one time
that the distinctive color of Green teas was imparted to
them by being fired in copper pans. For this belief there
is not the slightest foundation in fact, as copper is never
used for the purpose, repeated experiments by unerring
tests having been made, but in not a single case has any
trace of the metal been detected.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Which has lately attracted so much attention, partakes
somewhat of the character of both the foregoing varieties.
Some botanists, however, claim that it is a distinct species,
while others who recognize but one genus, contend that
the India plant is but a wild type of the Chinese variety,
and that any difference existing between them is the
result of soil, climate and special culture. Planters on
the other hand distinguish many points of difference
between the China and India tea-plants. The leaf of the
latter when full grown measures from three to five inches
in length, while that of the former seldom exceeds three;
again, the leaf of the India species does not harden as
quickly during growth, which is an important consideration
in picking. The inflorescence of the latter also
varies from that of the Chinese variety, its usual state
being to have the flower solitary, and situated in the
axils of the leaves, the number varying from one to five.
In general, it is more prolific and matures quicker, which
renders it more profitable, as it affords a greater number
of pickings during the season; but it is still doubtful if it
is a true tea. In its geographical distribution, so far as
latitude is concerned, the India tea-plant approximates
most to the Black tea species of China, yet in its botanical
characteristics and general appearance as well as in the
size and texture of its leaves, it approaches nearer to the
Green tea variety.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two other species described by Loureiro, but unknown
to commerce, are classed as <i>Thea Cochinchinensis</i><a id='tn045'></a>,
found in a wild state in the north of Cochin-China, where
it is also extensively cultivated, but used medicinally by
the natives as a diaphoretic. And <i>Thea Oleosa</i> (oil tea),
grown in the vicinity of Canton, the seeds of which yield
an oil used for illuminating purposes as well as an article
of diet by the inhabitants. In addition to these there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>are also two doubtful species, known as <i>Cankrosa</i> and
<i>Candata</i>, referred to by Wallach, as growing in Silhet
and Nepaul.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SUBSTITUTES IN USE FOR TEA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Previous to the seventeenth century it had long been
the custom in many countries of Europe to make hot
infusions of the leaves of various plants, most notably
those of the <i>Salvia</i> (sage), which had at one time a high
reputation as a “<a id='tn046'></a>panacæa,” being greatly extolled by the
Solieman school of physic, as a potent factor for the
preservation of health, and it is the custom at the present
time in many other countries where it is difficult or
impossible to obtain China tea, to use the seeds or
leaves of other plants as substitutes, the active principle
of which, in many instances, is analagous, and in others
identical with it. Among the former are the leaves of
plants destitute of <i>theine</i> (the active principle of tea), but
which possesses some other stimulating properties, and
among the latter the leaves and seeds of other plants containing
that principle, and consequently producing the
same exciting effects, these include Coffee, Cocoa and</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Yerba Maté</i>—or “Paraguan tea,” a species of <i>Ilex</i>, or
holly, the leaves of which yield the same active principle
(<i>theine</i>) characteristic of the China tea-plant. So closely
does it resemble the latter in effect that many authorities
claim it to be a species of that shrub, upwards of forty
million pounds being annually produced and consumed
in Paraguay and other South American countries.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Coca Tea</i>—used extensively in Peru and Bolivia,
composed of the dried leaves of the Coca tree, but
though generally chewed, is more frequently prepared
as a tea by the natives. In the infusion it possesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>somewhat similar properties to China tea, and forms an
important article of international trade among the various
tribes, not less than thirty million pounds being annually
consumed there.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Guarana</i>—or “Brazilian tea,” prepared from the seeds
of the guarana by the inhabitants of the interior of that
country, and so rich are they in <i>theine</i> that they have
lately been adopted for the purpose of obtaining that
principle in larger quantities for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Ugni</i>—or “Chilian tea,” produced from the leaves of
that plant, but though generally used as a medicine, is
as often prepared as a beverage.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Cenopodium</i>—or “Mexican tea,” made from an
infusion of the leaves and seeds of that plant, but used
only as a remedy in the treatment of asthma and bronchitis
by the natives of that country.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Pimento</i>—or “Trinidad tea,” prepared from a decoction
of the leaves of the pimento, and is in common use
in that and other of the West India islands both as a
beverage and a medicine.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Bun-fullup</i>—or “Jungle tea,” found in the Naga range
in eastern Assam, and used by the Singphos in the same
manner as the Chinese species and also as a medicine.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Khat</i>—or “African tea,” produced from an extract of
the Khola nut, the active principle of which has recently
been ascertained to be identical with that of the tea of
commerce, is much used among the nomad tribes of
Somali, the Soudan and other African countries.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Cathadules</i>—or “Arabian tea,” prepared from the
leaves of that shrub in the same manner as ordinary tea,
and extensively cultivated there for that purpose, as
much attention being bestowed on it by the natives as on
coffee. The leaves are also chewed, when green, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>those of the Coca in South America, being highly intoxicating
in effect, particularly in the wild state.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Saxifraga</i>—or “Siberian tea,” produced from a
decoction of the leaves of that plant, but used only as a
beverage in the same manner as those of China tea.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Epilobium</i>—or “Russian tea,” is prepared from the
dried leaves of the common willow, and are also extensively
used for mixing with the regular teas of commerce,
commanding as high as four roubles a pound in the dried
state, for that purpose; being also in common use among
the poorer classes of that country as a substitute for
China tea.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Buxifolium</i>—or “Labrador tea,” is made from an
infusion of the leaves of that plant, and used extensively
as a beverage by the natives of that country and adjoining
provinces.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Appalachian</i>—or “Pennsylvania tea,” is prepared
from an infusion of the <i>Punos</i> plant found growing in a
wild state on the Allegheny mountains, and used as a beverage
as well as for the purpose of imparting heat; and
while very closely resembling the tea-plant of China in its
structural character, of its merits or drinking qualities as
a tea nothing definite has as yet been ascertained.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Ceanothus</i>—or “New Jersey tea,” known to the Indians
as “pong-pong,” is prepared from the leaves of Red-root,
and was at one time in general use and very popular among
the natives of Virginia and the Carolinas, and was also
extensively used in Revolutionary times as a substitute
for China tea when refusal was made to pay the tax upon
the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Chimonanthus</i>—or “English tea,” recently obtained
from the leaves of that plant, and used as a substitute for
China tea, as well as for mixing with it. Originally a
native of China and Japan, it has been acclimatized in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>country, where it is at present extensively used alone and
as an adulterant.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Coffee-leaf Tea</i>—in use in many of the Coffee-growing
countries, most notably in Arabia, Sumatra and the
West India islands. It is prepared from the roasted
leaves of the coffee-tree in the same manner as China
tea, the natives of these countries particularly preferring
it to any decoction made from the berries of the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Strawberry-leaf Tea</i>—obtained from the leaves of
the common strawberry shrub, carefully dried and cured
after the manner of the China plant. They are prepared
and used in Germany particularly as a tea; they yield a
very close imitation of the liquor and flavor of the regular
tea of commerce, so much so that quite an industry
has sprung up in their cultivation and preparation as a
substitute for tea in that country. The celebrated “Faham
tea” of the Mauritius being still another remarkable substitute
for the tea of China. But as with many of the
foregoing should be regarded in the light of medicine
rather than that of a regular beverage.</p>

<p class='c009'>That this characteristic element <i>Theine</i> should be present
not only in the Tea-plant of China and Coffee-plant of
Arabia, but also in so many others widely differing, so
remote in situation, and so unlike in appearance, and
from which millions of people in all parts of the world
draw a refreshing and exhilarating beverage, is a striking
and beautiful fact in nature. <i>Under such a fact there may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>be more significance than science has yet elicited.</i></p>

</div>
<hr class='c007'>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_4 c008'>The Chinese, from time immemorial, have been
accustomed to raising their tea on every available
space of ground; on barren hill-side, marshy plain
and other patches of land unsuited for other purposes.
Most of the gardens are, however, situated in hilly
districts, but in almost all of them the soil is poor and
sandy, varying considerably, even in districts alike famous
for the perfect growth of the plant.</p>

<p class='c009'>The soil of the gardens situated on the hills is composed
chiefly of a brownish clay, containing large proportions
of vegetable matter intermixed with fragments of
slate, quartz and sand-stone, held together by a calcareous
basis of granite. A soil, in fact, very similar to that
which produces pine and scrub-oak, while on the plains
it is darker, but containing a still greater proportion of
vegetable matter, enriched by sewerage but invariably
well underdrained by natural declivities. Yet while many
of the gardens are situated on the tops of mountains,
among pine trees in some districts, and along river banks
on others, the Chinese, as a rule, prefer ground that is
only moderately elevated, in sunny sites, everything else
being favorable. Many of the latter yield more abundantly,
but the product of the former is invariably the
finest in quality.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>With regard to climatic essentials the plant endures a
tropical temperature well, at the same time accommodating
itself to the cold of winter without injury. But when
cultivated for commercial uses in such latitudes the
seasons are found too short for its profitable production
there, and while it is successfully grown at zero cold in
some districts, it is nevertheless most lucratively cultivated
in climates where the thermometer rarely falls more
than six degrees below the freezing point. The climate
varies to a considerable extent in the different districts of
China where tea is grown, being excessively warm in the
southern, and intensely cold in the northern provinces,
snow being on the ground for days together in the latter
or green tea producing districts. And though it has
been proved by experiment that this variety will bear a
greater degree of cold than the black, considerable snow
falls annually in the province of Fo-kien, where Black
teas are grown. The most important climatic consideration,
however, is the amount of rain-fall, a dry climate
being altogether unfit for tea cultivation; a hot, moist or
damp one being proved the best. The rain-fall in the
most profitable tea districts ranges from 80 to 100
inches per annum, the more falling in the spring months
the better, and that too must be equally diffused. But
where irrigation can be systematically introduced, this
is of less importance.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PLANTING AND PICKING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Tea is invariably raised from seed, in China, collected
in the fall after the last crop has been gathered and placed
in sand to keep them fresh during the winter months,
and sown the following spring in nurseries. In sowing the
seed from six to eight are put in pots about an inch below
the surface, usually four feet apart, and covered with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>rice-husks or parched earth. In growing, many of the
seeds prove abortive, scarcely one in five germinating.
When the nurslings have attained a height of from four
to six inches they are transplanted to the beds of the
gardens in which they are to grow four to five feet
apart. The plants are never manured in China, nor
does it appear to be customary to prepare the ground
for their reception, it being claimed by many authorities
that manure, while it increases the yield, invariably
spoils the flavor of the tea. Chinese growers in general
asserting that teas produced without the aid of manure
are always the most fragrant and aromatic.</p>

<p class='c009'>The plantations are laid out in the early spring, and
being well watered by the copious rains which fall during
this season, the young plants establish themselves, requiring
very little care thereafter. Until they have attained
a height of about 18 inches, the weeds are pulled regularly,
not raked, and the leading shoots pinched to induce
them to become numerous and bushy. When the season
is dry they are saturated with rice-water and the roots
covered, and if severely cold they are protected by a
wrapping of straw, rising up in a cluster when the rains
come and become firmly established, after which they
require very little more attention except occasional weeding,
until they are three years old. In some districts the
branches are periodically pruned, the constant abstraction
of the foliage having a tendency to reduce the height
and expand laterally making them resemble a collection
of plants rather than single shrubs, the size of the leaves
in such cases being smaller than when the plants are
suffered to grow at will, but covering the branches so
thickly as to prevent the hand being thrust through.
An eastern exposure is avoided when near the sea, and
care is also taken not to overshadow them by huge trees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>or noxious plants, certain notions prevailing concerning
the injurious influence of such trees when growing too
near the tea plants. When the soil is good and the
season favorable the leaves can be picked when the
plants are two years old, but if poor and dry, three years
are usually required for them to mature. On the larger
plantations three years are generally allowed before
beginning to gather the first crop or picking. A tea
plantation at this age when seen at a distance resembles
a shrubbery of evergreens, the view being very picturesque,
the gardens representing a series of terraces
descending to the plain, and the rich dark-green leaves
affording a pleasing contrast to the strange and oft-times
barren scenery with which they are so frequently surrounded.
There is a close analogy between the tea
plantations of China and the vineyards of France, the
quality of the tea varying according to the situation of
the sites, the nature of the soil and their exposure to
climatic changes. Thus, there are in China plantations
of tea enjoying reputations equal to those of the best
vineyards of Burgundy, Champagne and Bordeaux.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are three regular pickings in the course of a
year. The first known as the <i>Shon-cheun</i> or “Early
spring,” occurring about the middle of April or beginning
of May, according to the district, the product of
which is termed <i>Taou-cha</i> or “head tea,” a very superior
kind, consisting of the youngest, tenderest, and most
delicate leaves and leaf-buds just expanding. The quantity
obtained from this picking is limited in quantity but
simply superb in quality, the very finest teas known to
commerce, being prepared from them. The leaves are
selected with the greatest care and picked with the
utmost caution, such pains being taken to insure its
excellence that for weeks before the harvest commences,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the packers, who have been previously trained are prohibited
from eating fish or other food considered unclean,
lest by their breath they should contaminate the leaves,
being also compelled to bathe two or three times daily
in the picking season, as well as wear gloves during
the operation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second picking, called <i>Er-chuen</i> or “Second
spring,” takes place between the end of May and beginning
of June, when the branches are literally covered
with leaves, and yielding what is known in China as <i>Tzu-cha</i>
or “filial tea,” from the fact of its producing the
largest quantity, constituting the most important crop of
the season and forming the principal one exported, but
being greatly inferior to the first in point of quality.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>San-chuen</i>, or “third crop,” is gathered in July
when the shrubs are searched for leaves, and the product
converted into what is termed <i>Wu-kua-cha</i> or “tea without
aroma,” and though still more inferior to the preceding
ones in quality and quantity, is nevertheless an important
one commercially, forming the bulk of that exported as
well as for blending with and reducing the cost of the
preceding crop. A few leaves of the first picking will
support five successive immersions, yielding five cups of
moderately strong tea; the second supplying only two
and the third but one of the same strength to a like
quantity.</p>

<p class='c009'>A fourth picking or rather “gleaning,” termed the
<i>Chiu-lu</i> or “Autumn dew,” is made in the more prolific
districts in September and October, the product of which
is known as <i>Ta-cha</i> or “old tea,” but of little value
commercially. The leaves being large, coarse and
almost sapless, are generally retained for home consumption
by the poorer Chinese or for dyeing purposes,
and still another grade is sometimes made by chopping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>up the stems and twigs of the foregoing with a shears, a
practice, however, much to be condemned. The operation
of picking is one of the greatest nicety, only women
and children being employed in its performance. A
small basket is strung by a cord around the neck of
each picker, in such a manner as to leave the hands
free, a larger basket being placed near for general use.
The branch is held by one hand while the leaves are
carefully plucked with the other, for, except in the latter
gatherings, no portion of the stem or stalk must be
broken off with the leaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The quality of the tea largely depends on the exact
time of picking, as the choicest leaves may be changed
into an inferior grade of tea on a single night if the
exact proper time to pick them be neglected. The
practice of picking the young leaf-buds just as they are
beginning to unfold would also prove greatly injurious
to the plants, were it not for the copious rains that fall
during the season of picking, causing fresh leaves to
sprout out and elaborate the sap necessary to constitute
the further growth of the shrub. The weather also exerts
a great influence upon the character of the tea, as, for
instance, when the rains fall equably and a bright sun
appears after heavy showers, the plants become thick and
flourishing, the leaves bright green in color, elastic in
texture and much richer in flavor. Whereas, when too
much falls at one time, they become mildewed, broken
and less flexible and limited, stunted and sapless when
too little falls during the season of growth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The product of single plants vary so much that it is
difficult to estimate the average quantity. A plant of
three years’ growth yielding only about 8 ounces of
green leaves to a picking, equivalent to about 80 pounds
per acre, while at five years’ growth the same plant <a id='tn056'></a>will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>produce five times that quantity, but the quality of the
tea will not be near so good. One Chinese authority
states that 2 catties, about 2 pounds, of green leaves are
obtained from the more celebrated trees, but that the
average quantity was between 10 taels and 1 cattie, or
from 1 pound to 22 ounces annually, adding that a
single <i>mou</i> (acre) of land contained from 300 to 400
plants. From these varying statements it is evident that
no definite amount can be fixed on as an average product
per plant, per acre or per annum. The average collection
for each picker is from 14 to 16 pounds of raw leaves
per diem, the average wages varying from four to eight
cents per day, according to the skill of the picker.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CURING AND FIRING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>As a general rule in China the small growers do not
prepare the tea for market, simply curing them up to a
certain point in which condition they dispose of it to the
merchant or commission man, locally known as “tea-men,”
who send agents into the country and who buy it
in small quantities from the growers and carry it to <i>hongs</i>
or warehouses established at different points in the tea
districts. In this preliminary preparation the leaves
when first collected by the grower are spread out in light
layers on straw mats and exposed to the sun until they
are thoroughly withered, when they are gathered up and
placed on bamboo trays and triturated until a large portion
of the sap or juice is pressed out. After this operation
they are again exposed to the sun and then dried
in rattan cylinders, separated in the middle by a partition,
covered on top, and underneath of which is a chafing
vessel of ignited charcoal. The leaves when thrown into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>this concavity are constantly agitated until the process is
completed, finishing the cultivator’s work, the leaves
being delivered to the merchant or factor in this state.
The quantity for a “chop” or shipment being selected
according to the quality of the leaf and the district producing
it. The merchant or factor has them picked over
by women and children to remove the stems and fibre
which still remain attached to the young sprouts before
completing its final preparation for the foreign market.
The drying, buying and transporting of the leaves from
the gardens to the hongs occupies considerable time,
during most of which the but partially prepared tea is
very much at the mercy of the elements.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea leaves, when first picked, possess none of the color,
odor or flavor of the tea of commerce, these properties
being developed by the numerous processes to which
they are subjected in the operation of curing and firing,
and for which the Chinese have a long vocabulary of
technical terms. The definition of which, as vouchsafed
to the “outside barbarians,” are intended more to
mystify rather than elucidate the art. The operations
of Tea manufacture may, however, be classified in the
following sequence: Evaporating—Fermenting—Sunning—Firing—Rolling;
each process having to be
carried to a certain specific point, or if under or overdone,
the leaf is spoiled and the tea correspondingly
injured.</p>

<p class='c009'>The partially withered leaves are packed in small cotton
bags, loosely tied at mouth, and placed in open
wooden troughs or boxes perforated at the sides with
numerous holes, in which they are pressed and kneaded
by the feet, to expel all superfluous moisture, the object
being to extract all excess of tannin the principle to
which tea owes its bitterness and astringency. If <a id='tn058'></a>the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>leaves be fermented without previously going through
this process, the tea will be too pungent and bitter.
The fluid driven out through the holes is of a greenish,
semi-viscid nature, the quantity expelled from the
leaves being considerable. Properly evaporated, the
leaves when pressed in the hand return to their regular
shape, the stem bending double without breaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>The process of fermentation is accomplished by next
emptying the leaves into bamboo baskets and covering
them with cotton or felt mats, to cause a retention of
heat and hasten the fermentive changes. Having been
allowed to stand in this condition, the time requisite for
this process, being learned only by experience, being more
rapid in dry, warm weather than in cool and damp. If
the leaves be allowed to remain in a heap after evaporating,
so that heating by natural fermentation should
occur, the tea will be greatly injured. The process is
stopped by emptying the leaves and spreading them
out on large mats, exposed to the sun’s rays. The effect
of proper fermentation is to make the tea richer, smoother
and more pleasing in flavor. Tea in this respect being
like tobacco, which if dried over a fire when first cut,
becomes so sharp and bitter as to sting the tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the process of “sunning” the leaves are tossed
up and turned over repeatedly, so that the whole may
be diffused and thoroughly permeated by the sun. With
bright sunshine one hour’s exposure is sufficient, after
which they are ready for the final processes of firing
and curling. One of the results of the sunning process
is to evaporate in a greater degree the properties that
produce nervousness or wakefulness in the tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>As in the case of its botanical classification, much error
and confusion for a long time existed with regard to the
production of the varieties known to commerce as Green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>and Black teas. It was claimed at one time that the
former were prepared exclusively from the species
botanically termed <i>Thea Viridis</i>, and the latter came
from <i>Thea Bohea</i>. It was also stated that the difference
in color was due to a variation in the soil, climate and
methods of cultivation, and again that Black teas were
prepared only from plants grown on hilly sites, and Green
teas solely from those cultivated on the plains in a soil
enriched by manure. These botanical names and
groundless conjectures have for a long time misled the
public, later and more careful investigation fully disproving
such erroneous impressions. But while it is now
admitted that the greater portion of the respective commercial
varieties known as Green and Black teas are prepared
from the corresponding botanical species in their
respective districts, it is more from custom, convenience
or demand than from any other cause. The manufacturers
cater to the latter, the workmen also preferring
to make that kind best with which they have the most
experience. Chinese tea men now admitting that both
kinds are prepared at the will or pleasure of the manufacturers
in the Black and Green tea districts. At Canton
and other treaty ports in China it is an open secret that
both varieties are prepared from either species according
to the demand, the difference in color being entirely due
to the different methods of preparation from the first
stage. In the</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PREPARATION OF GREEN TEAS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>When the leaves are brought in from the gardens,
they are spread out thinly on flat bamboo trays, where
they are allowed to remain exposed from one to two
hours, in order to evaporate any superfluous moistures,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the time depending much on the state of the weather,
after which they are removed to terraces or verandahs
built expressly for the purpose of firing and curling, and
containing from ten to twenty small furnaces about three
feet high, each having at the top a series of shallow pans,
termed <i>Kuo</i>, built into brick-work, low in front, but rising
gradually at the sides and back, having a flue beneath
and a fireplace at one end. The pans are heated to a
certain degree by a charcoal fire made in the furnaces
underneath. Charcoal being used exclusively for the
purpose, as smoke of any kind would injure the flavor of
the tea. A limited quantity of raw leaves are thrown
into the <i>Kuo</i> at a time, rapidly moved about and shaken
up with both hands until they become affected by the
heat, making a cracking noise and give out considerable
vapor, the freshest and <a id='tn061'></a>juiciest cracking first.</p>

<p class='c009'>The operators meantime continue to stir them rapidly
as possible with their bare hands until they become too
hot to be endured, the object being to expose them
equally to the action of the heat, and at the same time
prevent them from burning or scorching. When the
heat becomes too intense they are lifted rapidly above
the <i>Kuo</i> and allowed to fall gradually to cool them, any
burned leaves being instantly removed. After being
allowed to remain in this state from four to five minutes,
during which they become moist and flaccid, they are
quickly removed with a shovel resembling a fan and
transferred to a long, low table made of split bamboo and
covered with matting and surrounded by several <i>Saihoos</i>,
who divide the leaves among them, each taking as
many as he can hold in his hands, rolling them from left
to right with a circular motion into the form of a ball,
which is compressed and rolled upon the table, to rid
them of any excess of sap or moisture, and at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>time curl or twist the leaves. During this process they
are frequently shaken out and passed from hand to hand
with a rapid motion, until they reach the head workman,
who examines them carefully to see if they have attained
the requisite twist, after which they are separated and
spread out in bamboo trays until the remainder have
undergone the same process. A second set of operatives
now collect them and turn them over and over, toss and
retoss them in the air to a considerable height, while a
third keeps fanning them in order that they may cool
more speedily and retain their curl longer, those containing
the most sap curling quickest, tightest and retaining
it the longer. When the firing and curling operations are
completed, the leaves are again exposed to the action
of the air, so as to admit the passing away of the
expressed moisture and at the same time impart a crisp
appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a sufficient quantity of leaves has been rolled
they are again placed in the <i>Kuos</i>, under which a slow
but steady charcoal fire has been kept burning and stirred
with a rapid motion by the hands of the <i>Saihoo</i> until
they become thoroughly dried and the green color permanently
fixed, that is, until there is no longer any danger
of them turning black. At this stage the leaves are
of a dull-green color, becoming brighter as they cool, in
which state they are termed by the Chinese <i>Mao-cha</i> or
“Cat tea.” The next and last process consists of winnowing
or passing the leaves through sieves of varying
sizes to free them from stems, dust and other extraneous
matter, and separate them into the different kinds of
Green Tea known to commerce. After which they are
again refired, the coarser leaves once and the finer grades
three to four times in order to bring out the color more
fully and make them retain their curl longer. In the</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>PREPARATION OF BLACK TEAS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The leaves undergo the same process of evaporation
and fermentation as with the green, but for a much longer
period. They are spread out thinly on large mats and
allowed to lie in this condition for at least twenty-four
hours, after which they are gathered up and thrown in
the air and allowed to fall back again in order to separate
them. They are next turned and returned for a considerable
time, being slightly beaten or patted with the
hands meantime until they become soft and pliable, when
they are again heaped and allowed to lay in this state for
about an hour, and when examined, at the end of this
time they are found to have undergone a slight change,
becoming darker in color, moist and flaccid in texture
and emitting a sweet, fragrant odor. At this stage they
are placed in the <i>Kuos</i> and fired for about five minutes,
rolled on bamboo tables and shaken out thinly on sieves
placed outside the “hong” and exposed to the oxidizing
action of the atmosphere for about three hours, during
which the operatives are employed in going over the
sieves, turning and separating the leaves from each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the leaves have lost considerable sap and become
correspondingly reduced in size they are next removed
into the factory and placed a second time in the pans for
three or four minutes, rolled as before and put into tubular
bamboo baskets, narrow in the middle and wide at
both ends, and suspended over charcoal fires for from
five to six minutes, during which they are carefully stirred
and watched until they begin to assume a dark color, the
operations of heating and twisting being repeated from
three to four times, the heat being gradually reduced at
each operation, and during which the operators make
holes with their hands through the centre of the leaves
in order to equally diffuse the heat and give vent to any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>smoke or vapor from the charcoal. They are then
covered up, placed aside until they become perfectly dry
and their black color firmly established, improving in
appearance as they cool. When there is no longer any
danger of their becoming green, the final processes of
sifting, sorting and grading is performed at the convenience
of the workmen.</p>

<p class='c009'>With four <i>Kuos</i> and six <i><a id='tn064'></a>Saihoos</i> only from 400 to
500 pounds of prepared tea can be cured in a single day,
it requiring 400 pounds of raw leaves to produce 100
pounds of cured tea. The leaves of the earlier pickings
being smaller, more tender and juicy, the yield is correspondingly
less, the leaves containing the most sap
curling quickest, tightest and retaining it longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may here be observed in regard to the preparation
of Green and Black teas that the leaves intended for conversion
into the latter variety are allowed to lie exposed
to the action of the sun and air for a considerably longer
time than those of the former, that they are raked and
tossed about until they become more soft and pliant, and
that they are allowed to ferment longer before firing.
And, again, that after firing and curling they are exposed
to the oxydizing influence of the atmosphere in a moist
state for hours previous to being fired a second time and
finally dried in baskets over a slow fire. While the
leaves intended for Green teas are immediately fired and
curled after being picked, and dried as quickly as possible
after the rolling process has been completed. The
differences in the methods of preparation are therefore
most marked, and satisfactorily accounts for the difference
in their color, flavor and aroma, as well as for the
effects—nervousness and wakefulness—produced in some
constitutions by Green teas, due to the greater amount
of sap contained in the leaves.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>But, for the at one time commonly-received opinion
that the distinctive color of Green teas was imparted by
curing in copper pans, there is not the slightest foundation
in fact, since copper is never used for the purpose,
repeated experiments by unerring tests having failed to
find a single trace of that metal in any Green teas.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later investigations proving that the hue of Green
teas is due as much to their manipulation as to the
degree of heat at which they are fired. It has been
found that at equal temperatures the leaves of both will
turn black if allowed to lie as long before or during
firing, the green color being retained only by the excessive
motion, the latter tending to accelerate the power of
evaporation of the juices, and which is further augmented
by incessant fanning.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>GRADING AND PACKING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The final grading of Green teas also differs from that
of Black, there being two distinct styles or “makes” of
the tea—rolled and twisted. They are first separated
and then sifted, in which operation four sieves are used,
two to separate the small from the large round or rolled
leaves, and two for the curled or twisted. After being
sorted or separated they are again fired into deeper pans
at a much higher temperature, and winnowed while hot
in large circular bamboo trays, to free them from any
remaining chaff or dust, the choicer grades being hand-picked
previous to being sent to the <i>Twa-tu-tia</i> (Tea
market), which is held in the nearest town or village to
the district of production. The inferior grades are
generally disposed of in an unassorted condition to the
native factors or foreign merchants, who afterwards sort,
grade and pack them for export.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>The grading or classing of Black teas for their first
market is performed differently in the different districts.
The most common custom, however, is to sort the dried
leaves at the <a id='tn066'></a>hongs, according to their size, style and
quality, by collecting them in heaps or large layers, and
rake them down so as to mix them well together and
make them uniform in grade and average cost; the leaves
being more often the product of different plantations,
and even districts. The product of each plantation is
brought by coolies in cotton bags or bamboo baskets to
the tea market, and when disposed of are removed to the
“Go-downs,” or warehouses, situated in the adjacent
villages, where the teas of a district are stored until they
are disposed of to the native factors or foreign agents,
who travel through the country in the interest of commission
houses or merchants at the treaty ports, and by
whom they are again fired, graded and winnowed to free
them from any remaining impurities. When the orders are
filled the teas are transported across the country on the
shoulders of coolies, or sent down by river or canal in
“junks” to the shipping ports, the time occupied in
transit varying according to means, being usually from six
to eight weeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Previous to being packed for export in the lead-lined
chests in which they are received in this country, the
teas are again subjected to a still further firing, with the
object of totally evaporating any moisture they may have
absorbed in transit from the interior or by laying exposed
in the storehouses, as well as to better fit them for the
long sea voyage, after which the tea is weighed in
“catties,” and placed in the chests, the packer pressing
it down with his hands. When another cattie is put
in he steps on top, places his hands behind his back
and throwing his head forward goes through a sort of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>tread-mill dance, until the leaves are tightly compressed
into the smallest possible compass. More tea is then put
in and pressed down in the same manner until the chest
is filled, when the leaden lid is put on and soldered, the
chest being nailed, clamped, matted and rattaned later,
numerous hands, men and women, being employed in its
final packing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before matting a Chinese character termed a “Chop-mark”
is placed on the side of each chest, ostensibly to
denote the packer or picking, but although the same
“crop” or brand is received year after year from the same
shipper it does not necessarily follow that the grade or
quality will be the same or even equal to that of the
preceding ones.</p>

<p class='c009'>The term “chop” in Chinese means contract, and does
not, as is claimed, refer to the crop or picking of any particular
garden or season. In trade it is applied to a quantity
of tea frequently composed of the product of different
gardens, or piens (localities) and even districts averaged
or made uniform in the piens of the Twa-tu-tia
by the factors before forwarding to the shipping ports.
When a sufficient quantity of a certain specified grade
has been secured from several growers to make up
a chop, it is carried to a warehouse in the adjacent village,
where it is all mixed together, averaged, refired and
packed for the foreign market. The quantity for a chop
being selected according to the quality of the leaf and
the district producing it, and considering how chops are
made up—a few piculs from several gardens, often widely
apart, they are wonderfully uniform in grade. Still,
although year after year the same “chops” are received
from the same shippers, it does not follow that the chops
of one year or season will be as fine as those of the preceding
or of equal quality. It being by no means an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>unusual practice for the packers in the interior to leave
the chests unmarked until they reach the shipper, who,
knowing the chops must be in demand at that particular
season in the consuming countries, supplies them to order,
or, at least, not to use one of bad repute.</p>

<p class='c009'>The average cost of medium to fine grades of tea is
40 taels (about $20) per picul (133⅓ pounds) laid down
at the port of shipment is as follows at the present
time: The refiring, packing, leading, chests, matting
and rattaning varying from $3 to $4 per picul more.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c008'>Tea as it occurs in commerce is the dried leaves
of the tea-plant, and is generically classified as
Green and Black<a id='tn069b'></a>, under which names it is best
known to the public. Commercially, they are classed as
China, Japan, India, Ceylon, and Java teas, but are again
divided into numerous varieties and grades, having terms
derived from the districts and localities of production, or
indicative of age, form, or quality, from the delicate product
of the young leaf-bud up to that of the large, old,
and fully expanded leaf. These numerous appellations
which distinguish the commercial qualities of tea being
almost entirely of Chinese origin.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHINA TEAS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Tea and China are almost synonymous terms. It is
indisputably the “Land of tea.” Its cultivation forms the
chief industry of that country, and has been the largest
contributor to the revenue of the government for centuries,
its export being the principal feature of all her foreign
dealings. The welfare of the inhabitants of her fairest
provinces depend on its production. It has been in
universal use among them from time immemorial, forming
not only the regular beverage of the people, but also
administering to the luxury of the epicure. They drink it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>at all times and under all circumstances from early morning
until late at night, in sickness or in health, working
or playing, traveling or resting, all business being transacted
there between two cups of tea. In brief, it is the
natural beverage of the country constituting what wine
is to the French, beer to the German and ale to the English,
and but without which no Chinese family could live
or thrive.</p>

<p class='c009'>Considering all this, the claim under the circumstances
that any other country is the “home of tea,” as is
attempted at the present time by some English writers, is
about as futile and absurd as the endeavor to substitute
Americus for Columbus, or Bacon for Shakespeare. And
not only is China the original home of tea, but in addition,
<i>China Tea is the only true tea, surpassing that of all
other countries in every property and quality constituting
and distinguishing tea, and possessing certain distinctive
characteristics peculiar to and contained in no other variety
grown or known</i>. Yet while grown to a greater or less
extent all over that vast empire, its cultivation for commercial
purposes appears to be chiefly confined to the
eastern provinces of Che-kiang, Kiang-see, Gan-hwuy
and Fo-kien, some little also being produced for export
in the western province of Sze-chuan.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>China Green Teas</h4>

<p class='c015'>are produced principally in the provinces of Che-kiang,
Gan-hwuy and Kiang-see, and are known to trade as
Sunglos, Moyunes, Hychows, Fychows, Tienkes, Tayshings,
Pingsueys, Cantons, and Country green teas, district
terms and grading in the order named. These varieties
being again subdivided into Gunpowders, Imperials,
Hysons, Young Hysons, Hyson-Pekoes, and Hyson-Skin—appellations
denoting age, size, style, or form of make.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span><b><span class='large'>Sunglo</span></b>—Famous in China at one time as the district
where Green teas were first produced, and which were for
centuries the finest grown in that country. Latterly,
however, it has greatly declined as a tea-producing district,
the quality also degenerating at the same time, much
of that now sold as “true Sunglo” being only so in
name. They are what is known to trade as “Hill” or
high-district tea, natural green in color, exceedingly well
made and prepared, yielding a rich, straw-colored liquor,
clear and sparkling in the cup, fragrant and aromatic in
flavor. The infused leaf is small, symmetrical and uniform
to a high degree, in fact almost perfect in shape, an
invariable indication of youthfulness, fineness and tenderness.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Mo-Yuen</span></b>—Known to trade as “Moyune,” now produces
the bulk of the best Green teas received from
China. Grown principally on the plains or lowlands
adjacent to Sunglo from which fact they are sometimes
termed “Garden teas” in contradistinction to the upland
or “hill teas,” and to which they are inferior in make,
liquor, and flavor. They are of three kinds—“Nankin,”
“Pakeong,” and “Oochaine”—so named from the “<i>piens</i>”
or localities in which they are raised.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Nankin Moyune</span></b>—Is the most valuable, intrinsically
and commercially, being superior to the others in make,
color, draw and drink. The dried leaf is firmly rolled
or curled according to “make,” rich, natural green in
color, and extremely uniform in general appearance. The
infusion of the finer grades is light golden in tint, brisk,
and pungent in body, and possessing a flavor peculiar to
itself, technically termed “toasty.” It is deceptive in
drink owing to its light color in the cup, the body being
full and heavy, the infused leaf is small, but regular and
well-shaped and of a light-green hue.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span><b><span class='large'>Pakeong</span></b>—Differs from Nankin in many respects,
though grown in the same district. The dry leaf is
larger and more open, being what is termed “loosely
made,” duller in color and not as highly fired. The finer
grades, however, yield a rich, ripe liquor, comparatively
light in color and delicate in flavor, but lacking in that
“toastiness” for which the former are so much admired.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Oochaine</span></b>—Is a small leaf tea, generally darker in
color, heavier in body and more pungent in flavor, but
owing to its small size and imperfect preparation not as
well appreciated as it deserves.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Hy-chows</span></b>—Though raised in the adjoining district to
Moyune are nevertheless much inferior to them in both
leaf and liquor. The dry leaf, while firmly made and
regular in form, silvery-green in color and considered
attractive in appearance, is still very deceptive and lacking
in cup qualities. The infusion, although darker in
color and fairly pungent, is light in body and devoid of
fragrance, the infused leaf being dark, coarse and
irregular.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Fy-chows</span></b>—Are bold and rough in general appearance,
dull in color, dark and heavy in liquor, and somewhat
astringent in flavor, and on the whole an undesirable
sort.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Tien-kes</span></b>—While large and coarse in make are
pleasing in the hand, being chiefly sold on style, as they
will not stand the cup test in comparison with Moyunes.
The liquor is dark and thick, astringent and frequently
“smoky” in flavor, due to the high firing in the effort to
make them roll or curl tighter.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Tai-pings</span></b>—Like Tien-kes, look well in the hand,
being fairly well-made and stylish-looking, but of a
leaden-blue hue, the result of the “facing” or coloring-matter
used in their preparation in order to enhance their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>appearance. The infusion is dark and muddy in the cup,
flat and frequently “earthy” in taste, the infused leaf
being large, coarse, dark and irregular.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pingsueys</span></b>—Termed by the Chinese <i>Mien-pan-cha</i>
or “Bastard tea,” possess no intrinsic value really
as a tea, many experts contending that they are not
even allied to the tea plant, but prepared from the
leaves of some shrub remotely resembling it. The dry
leaf is very stylish and firmly made, but of a leaden-blue
color and “greasy” in appearance, gypsum and Prussian
blue being extensively used in their manipulation.
The liquor is dark and heavy, bitterly astringent and
“brassy” or metallic in flavor, while the infused leaf
is large, coarse and irregular in shape, dark-brown in
color, and recognizable from its dissimilarity to the true
tea-leaf.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Canton</span></b>—Called by the Chinese <i>Tchaw-cha</i> or “Lie-tea,”
is another spurious variety, manufactured in that
city from “spent” or exhausted tea leaves, that is, from
leaves once used and from which the vital properties
have been extracted. They are made by first grinding
and mixing them with a gluey compound to make them
adhere, and then rolled into the form of Imperials and
Gunpowders, as they cannot be curled or twisted, after
which they are artificially colored or faced with a preparation
of Prussian blue, kaolin and <a id='tn073'></a>turmeric. They are
smoothly rolled and leaden-blue in color, having a
peculiar greasy external appearance in the hand, due
to the mineral matter used in their preparation. They
do not possess a single physiological property of tea,
yielding only a greenish viscid substance, dark and
muddy in color, the so-called leaves disintegrating and
settling in a pasty consistency at the bottom of the cup,
the liquor being devoid of every semblance of tea.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span><b><span class='large'>Country Greens</span></b>—Are uncultivated teas gathered in
outlying districts, rough and uncouth in appearance,
bitter and astringent in liquor, wild or “grassy” in flavor.
The leaves when <a id='tn074'></a>unfurled are exceedingly large, rough
and uncouth in the cups, having every appearance of a
wild or uncultivated tea-leaf.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>Sub-Varieties of Green Teas.</h4>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Gunpowder</span></b>—Termed by the Chinese <i>Choo-cha</i> or
“Pearl tea,” so named from its small, round and “shotty”
form. It is generally prepared from the smallest and
youngest leaves of the tea plant, its quality corresponding
to the picking and district of growth. The product
of first crop is sometimes known as “Pinhead,” from its
extremely small, globular and granulated appearance.
That prepared from the second crop is larger and not as
hard rolled, while the third and fourth pickings are
respectively still larger and more irregular in form, but,
while darker and heavier in liquor, they are not near
as delicate or fragrant in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Imperial</span></b>—Derives its trade name from being the
make or style of tea used in the Imperial household and
the wealthier Chinese. That exported is prepared from
the larger and older leaves of the respective pickings
and rolled in the same manner as the former, from which
fact it is sometimes called “Big Gunpowder” and “Pea-leaf.”
But while larger and bolder in make it possesses much
the same drawing and drinking qualities, excepting that
it is heavier and darker in liquor and not as delicate or
aromatic in flavor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The true Imperial tea, known in China as “Flower tea,”
not because it is prepared from the flower or blossom of
the tea-plant, as is erroneously supposed, but from its
being considered the “perfection of tea.” This variety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>is never exported owing to its limited production and being
also very lightly fired in curing, it is very susceptible to
moisture, the damp of a sea voyage tending to greatly
impair its delicate properties.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Young Hyson</span></b>—Is a corruption of the Chinese term,
<i>Yu-he-tsien</i> or “Early spring,” from being picked early in
the season. In make the leaves of the finer grades are
extremely small, firmly, if not artistically twisted, and
almost wiry in texture, being prepared from the
youngest and tenderest leaves just expanding. The
leaves of the later pickings are correspondingly larger
and looser in make and appearance, and relatively
inferior in drawing and drinking qualities to the earlier
pickings.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Hyson</span></b>—Known to the Chinese as <i>He-tsien</i>, “Flourishing
spring,” from being gathered in the full spring-time
is a large, loosely-curled leaf, prepared from the
older leaves of the respective pickings which cannot
from their size and lack of succulence be either
rolled or curled. They bear the same relation to
Young Hysons that Imperials do to Gunpowder, and
preserving the same characteristics in a relatively minor
degree.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Hyson-Pekoe</span></b>—Called by the Chinese “<i>Loung-tsien</i>”<a id='tn075'></a>,
literally “Tea-of-the-wells-of-the-Dragon,” a term used to
describe an exceedingly rare, peculiar and expensive
variety of green tea, which, owing to its extreme tenderness
and delicacy and very light firing is never exported.
It has a small, evenly-curled leaf, rich, natural green in
color, with whitish, downy or silvery ends. The infusion
is of a pale or light-golden yellow tinge, clear and sparkling
as champagne in the cups and possessing what the
connoisseur would term a simply exquisite aroma or
“bouquet.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span><b><span class='large'>Hyson-Skin</span></b>—Termed by the Chinese <i>Twankay</i> or
“Refuse tea,” is composed of the largest and oldest
leaves, screenings or “<a id='tn076'></a>Fannings” of the foregoing varieties,
that cannot, owing to their coarse or broken condition,
be rolled or curled. It is large, loose and flat in
appearance, varying in color, liquor and flavor according
to the grade from which it is separated in screening.
Many of them, however, draw and drink exceedingly
well, making very useful teas for blending purposes.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>China Black Teas</h4>

<p class='c015'>comprise Oolongs, Congous, Souchongs and Scented
teas, and are principally produced in the south-eastern
provinces of Fo-kien and Kiang-nan.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>Oolong Teas.</h4>

<p class='c015'>The term Oolong is derived from the Chinese word
<i>Ou-loung</i>, signifying “Green dragon,” and is applied
to a variety of tea having a small greenish-yellow leaf
permeating through it. They are divided into six different
kinds—Amoys, Foochows, Formosas, Ankois,
Saryune, Padrae and Pekoe-Oolong teas, possessing as
many distinct flavors and characters caused by the variations
in soil, climate and mode of preparation.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Amoy Oolongs</span></b>—Are divided into Kokews, Mohea
and Ningyong from the localities where grown, and differ
much in size, style and character.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Kokew</span></b>—Is a large, dark, coarse-leaf tea, rough and
unsightly in the hand, but pungent and “grippy” in the
cup. The poorer grades possess a wild or “herby”
flavor—a quality, strange to say, appreciated by some
few tea-drinkers, but strongly objected to by the majority
of consumers.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span><b><span class='large'>Mohea</span></b>—Is a large, light and somewhat “chaffy”
leaf tea, light-colored and light-bodied in the cup, but
withal smooth and pleasant in flavor. But, although
lacking in strength, it is a serviceable tea for blending purposes,
particularly in combination with a heavy Congou
or Assam, in the proportion of one of the latter to four
parts Mohea, being too thin when used alone.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'><a id='tn077a'></a>Ningyongs</span></b>—Are light in weight, greenish-yellow in
color and stylish-looking in the hand, though not well
made or twisted. They are also very pleasing in the
cup, possessing a sort of “hickory-nut” flavor for which
they are much admired, but are thin in body and lacking
in “snap.” It is contended by some experts that if this
variety were converted into a green tea it would rank
with a light drawing Moyune in drinking qualities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Amoy at one time was the greatest Tea mart in the
world, exporting as much as 500,000 half-chests per
annum, but which has now fallen to less than 50,000, due
in part to careless cultivation and indifferent curing. The
lower grades are stemmy, dusty and frequently adulterated
with spurious or exhausted leaves. Many of the
finer grades, however, still turn out splendidly in the
cup, rivalling the lower grades of Foochow and Formosa,
being frequently faced and sold for the latter when
these grades are scarce or high. It does not require an
expert, however, to detect the substitution, as they are
totally devoid of the fragrant and “nosey” flavor that so
distinguish the latter.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'><a id='tn077b'></a>Foochow Oolongs</span></b>—Are produced in the province
of Fo-kien, and are, without exception, the truest and
finest variety of the genus tea grown in any country,
China not excepted. They are usually put up in “chops,”
quantities bearing the brand or chop-mark of the grower
or packer, which are again divided. “Lines,” termed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>trade, “Firsts,” “Seconds,” “Thirds,” “Fourths,” and
sometimes “Fifths,” denoting the various pickings and
grading in the order named.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dried leaf of the “Firsts” or finer grades is black and
almost “silky” in texture, exceedingly well twisted and
crispy, but not brittle, yielding rather than breaking
when pressed in the hand. While the infusion is dark-golden
in color, rich, round and full bodied, very mellow
and fragrant in flavor, the infused leaf medium in size,
very regular in form and of a rich brown color.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “Seconds” are somewhat larger in leaf, looser in
make, not being quite as finely or evenly twisted but
possessing excellent “cup qualities,” being the favorite
with consumers who prefer full body, to delicate flavor.
The “Thirds” are still looser in make, bolder in style
and darker in liquor, heavier in body, and though not
near as high or fragrant in flavor are, nevertheless useful
and serviceable, particularly when they are composed of
what is known as “high district teas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The “Fourths and Fifths,” when there are any, are
correspondingly inferior in quality, the dried leaf of the
latter being especially large, coarse and rough in
appearance, brittle and chaffy in the hand, and frequently
dusty or stemmy, dark in draw but thin in body, lacking
in flavor, deteriorating rapidly after infusion, and devoid
of the high character that so distinguishes the former
grades of this variety. The principal “chops” now
known to trade comprise the “Tong-mow,” “Tong-lee,”
“Tong-shing,” “Chun-fah,” “Chun-fat,” “Sun-kee,”
“Cheong-kee,” “Com-we” and “Com-wo-kut chops.”</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Formosa Oolongs</span></b>—Also known to trade as “Tam-suis,”
from being shipped from that port, are unique in leaf,
and flavor differing widely in character, possessing a rich,
natural bouquet entirely unknown to any other variety.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>The dried leaf is dark greenish-yellow in color, evenly
and artistically curled, crisp and “crapy” in texture,
small, shapely, uniform, and green when infused, generally
“tipped” with a brownish edge, the result of fermentation.
The liquor is bright, clear, and golden in
the cup, body round and mellow, ripe and rich and
aromatic in flavor. A really choice Formosa tea when
drawn will fill a room with a delightful aroma peculiar to
itself, difficult to describe, but variously pronounced as
“jessamine,” “cowslip” or “primrose” odor, but still
totally unlike that of any other plant or flower in the
vegetable kingdom, having a “Formosa flavor” pure and
simple, attributed to the soil, and absorbed by the plants
during growth, and to preserve which it has to be continually
cultivated in new places. Unlike other varieties
the later pickings of Formosa teas are heavier and
stronger than the earlier gatherings; though sweet and
fragrant, are light-bodied and evanescent. The medium
and lower grades are dark-brown in color, somewhat
rough in style, not being as well cured or curled as the
finer sorts. The infusion is also darker in draw, fuller in
body, but not near as fragrant or aromatic in flavor, the
finer grades improving as it cools, the former deteriorating
under the same circumstances and revealing a slightly
“herby” taste.</p>

<p class='c009'>Formosa Oolongs are cultivated by native farmers
who have small gardens, some of whom do not raise
over one hundred pounds at a picking, but have from
three to five pickings in a season. Unlike other varieties,
the first picking of Formosa is the poorest, the second
crop being better and the last or autumn crop is best of
all. This inversion is due to climatic causes, the island
being visited with heavy rains during August, after which
the warm weather of September causes the plant to grow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>luxuriantly, filling the leaf with sap, added to which the
moisture of the atmosphere causes the leaves to ferment
quickly during the process of curing, allowing the
manufacturers to cure the leaf without exposing it to the
sun. The great strength of the leaf enables the manufacturer
to fire the leaves longer; the longer they are
fired the longer they will keep, the third crop, or
“Autumn teas,” that have been well-fired improving
with time after exposure to the air, the action of the
atmosphere bringing out the fragrance of the tea, the
toasty flavor at the same time disappearing.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Ankoi-Oolongs</span></b>—Are a doubtful species of the genus
tea, said to be prepared from the leaves of a shrub closely
resembling yet widely distinct in structure and character
from those of the true plant, found growing in a wild
state on the range of mountains known as the Anke
hills, separating the district of Amoy from <a id='tn080'></a>Foochow.
The leaf, in a dried state, is rough, coarse and reddish-brown
in color, poorly curled and ragged in general
appearance. In the infusion it is dark-brown, large and
irregular in form, notably dissimilar from that of a genuine
tea-leaf in all respects, while the liquor is dark-red,
oily or “earthy,” and bitterly astringent to the taste, qualities
contracted from the presence of oxides in the soil
in which they grow. Intrinsically, this variety possesses
no value really as tea, bearing the same relation to
Oolongs that Pingsueys do to Green teas, and although
known to the Chinese as “Bastard tea,” it is extensively
used by them in the reduction of Amoys, to which it
imparts a wild, rank or weedy flavor readily detected in
the cup.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Padrae-Oolong</span></b>—Is a scarce sort prepared in the
Bohea district from a species that is unsuited for
conversion into plain Oolong. The leaf is long, black,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>flattish, but finely made, after the manner of a Souchong,
and closely approximating to the latter in color, liquor
and flavor. They are chiefly exported to the Russian
market, where they are much esteemed for their unique
but superb drinking qualities.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pekoe-Oolongs</span></b>—Are what is known to trade as a
“Made tea,” that is, prepared from leaves which, from
their nature or quality, cannot be converted into an
Oolong or Green tea, or from leaves spoiled by imperfect
fermentation, smoke or fire in curing, flavored or scented
with Pekoe in order to disguise or conceal their defects.
The dried leaf is generally long, flat and very black,
being over-fired, while the liquor is dark-wine color,
sharp, pungent, but burnt to the taste, and approaching
to that of Tienke green in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Saryune</span></b>—Is a bold, dark-leaved variety, rather
loosely made and curled. The liquor is heavy, dark,
rich and pungent, brisk, but somewhat burnt in flavor,
the result of too high firing. The infused leaf is medium
in size, regular in form, dark-brown in color, with darker
edges, approximating to that of a Congou leaf in color
and style.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>CONGOU, SOUCHONG AND SCENTED TEAS,</h4>

<p class='c015'>known to trade in this country as “English Breakfast
teas,” from having at one time formed the staple shipment
to that country, are produced in the province of Kiang-see,
and are a distinct variety, differing in color, liquor
and flavor from the Oolong sorts. They are cultivated
chiefly on the <i>Bou-iu</i> (Bohea) mountains, in the district of
Woo-e-shan, which, though very sterile in some parts, are
literally covered with tea plantations. More of these
varieties are produced than of all others combined, the
product of the Pa-ta-shan range being classed among the
finest grown.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h4 class='c014'>CONGOU TEAS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The term Congou is a corruption of the Chinese term
<i>Kowng-foo</i>, meaning “laborious” or “assiduous sort,” more
time and labor being expended on their manipulation than
on the other varieties, and are commercially divided into
Kaisows or “Red-leaf” and Monings or “Black-leaf
Congou teas.”</p>

<h4 class='c014'>KAISOW<br><span class='small'>OR</span><br>RED-LEAF CONGOUS</h4>

<p class='c015'>include Chingwos, Seumoo, Suey-kut, Sin-chune,
Saryune, Cheong-soo, Cheong-lok, Cheong-syke, So-how,
Yung-how, Wang-hung and Yung-tong Congou teas.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Chingwos</span></b>—Are the finest of all the red-leaf sorts,
particularly when the crop is good; the dry leaf is well
curled or twisted, keeping well up to a certain point and
improving as it matures. The lower grades, however,
deteriorate very rapidly, and in proportion to the openness
or looseness of the leaf on arrival. Its special feature is
its delicate and, to a degree, fragrant flavor which it
imparts to other teas in combination, provided the other
teas are not too strong and coarse. The liquor is not, as
a rule, very dark, but reddish in hue, and possessing a
round, mellow flavor, for which it is more esteemed than
for its body or color in the cup.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Seumoo</span></b>—Is a long, bold, somewhat rough-leaved tea,
dark-red in color and “coarse” in flavor. The finer
grades are, however, fairly thick and strong in liquor,
many of them although round and full are frequently
dull and flavorless, but combining well with strong
Assams. Seumoos make an excellent base when combined
with the latter, the pungency of the Assam imparting
the briskness and body which it lacks when used
alone.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span><b><span class='large'>Suey-kut</span></b>—Is a brisk but mostly burnt variety, being
as a rule, too highly fired. The dry leaf of the first
pickings is evenly twisted, black and stylish in the hand,
its strength and flavor is but average, and quality generally
only fair in the cup. The commoner grades, though
usually well-made and pleasing in appearance, are frequently
stemmy or dusty.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Sin-chune</span></b>—Is neither a large or greatly valued
sort, the dry leaf being loose in make, mixed and ragged
in appearance, and objectionably dusty, while the liquor
is hard and dry to dullness, lacking both in flavor and
aroma.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Saryune</span></b>—Is the reddest of the Red-leaf teas, and
while one of the most serviceable of this variety, is not a
fine sort by any means, though often ripe and juicy. The
liquor is almost invariably strong and brisk, but burnt in
flavor, the result of too high firing, and with the exception
of a few of the finer grades the leaf is rarely well
curled, being generally open, red and rough in appearance,
the second and third crops being usually very dusty
or stemmy.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Cheong-soo</span></b>—Is a scarce sort, varying in quantity and
quality from year to year, but quite a desirable one,
particularly when the crop is good; but fine Cheong-soos
are rarely seen in this market.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Cheong-lok</span></b>—Is a tea of negative character, the
liquor possessing little or no strength and the leaf
having a rough, red, unsightly appearance in the hand.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Cheong-syke</span></b>—Is also best described by negatives, the
dry leaf being dark-brown and coarse, the liquor lacking
the strength of Sin-chune and the briskness of Saryune.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>So-how</span></b>—Is small and well made in leaf, dark, but rich
in liquor, and smooth and mellow in flavor for this variety
of tea.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span><b><span class='large'>Yung-how</span></b>—Closely approaches Suey-kut in appearance,
drawing and drinking qualities, but is less burnt
in taste and rather stronger, and more flavory in the
infusion.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Wang-hung and Yung-tong</span></b>—Are both high-fired,
brisk, but burnt varieties, dark-red in leaf and liquor, and
not, as a general rule, either useful or valuable sorts to
the dealer.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>MONING<br><span class='small'>OR</span><br>BLACK-LEAF CONGOUS</h4>

<p class='c015'>comprise Ning-chows, Oonfas, Oopacks, Oonams,
Kin-tucks, Kee-muns, Kiu-kiangs, Panyong, Hapyong,
Paklin and Paklums, and constitute the true Black teas
of China.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Ning-chow</span></b>—Is a small, evenly-curled leaf, greyish-black
in color and very stylish in general appearance,
the finer grades being “Pekoe-tipped” and flavored. The
infusion is dark red or wine-colored but delicate and
aromatic, more so than that of any tea of this variety,
while the infused leaf is small, tender, symmetrical and of
a bright brown or reddish tendency. The lower grades
are fairly thick and strong, making a useful tea for the retailer,
as they keep well and combine advantageously with
most other varieties, less regular and uniform, browner
and given to “choppiness” and dust. The liquor,
though of good color, is not as clear and bright, the
infused leaf being more markedly red than that of the
former sorts. The medium and lower grades are fairly
thick in the cup; but have a tendency to become overripe,
and while not keeping, still blend well with a
pungent Assam or light-bodied Oolong tea.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Oonfa</span></b>—While not as finely twisted or as handsome
as Ning-chow, is still the next most important of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Black-leaf Congous. The dried leaf of the finer grades
is bold in make, yielding a dark, heavy liquor, lacking in
fragrance, but proving a desirable sort where body and
strength is required. The medium grades are rough and
open, the liquor, though mostly strong, is often “tarry,”
and frequently sour when kept too long, while the lower
grades are thin in body and coarse in flavor, having
nothing to recommend them but their leaf, which is
generally free from dust.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Oopack</span></b>—Grown on the banks of the Yang Tse, a
little above Hankow, is a “crapy” black leaf tea, evenly
curled, but somewhat bold in style. When freshly fired
they are flavory and aromatic, but become dull and
“brassy” as the firing wears off, for which reason it is
not a good tea to keep. If used quick, however, it
blends well with broken Assam, when thick and heavy,
the commoner grades being fairly smooth and sweet in
the cup, though coarse and rough in the hand.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Oonams</span></b>—Are a class of tea somewhat resembling
Oopacks in style and draw, but preferable to the latter
approximating closer to Ning-chow in flavor. The dry-leaf
is also more evenly twisted, smaller and greyer and
the infusion fuller and stronger.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Kin-tuck</span></b>—Is comparatively a new variety, but is
rapidly becoming one of the most important of the
Congou sorts, the quality of the choicer grades being
especially good, rivalling the finest Ning-chows, particularly
when the crop is good.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Kee-mun</span></b>—Is another of the newest descriptions of
China Congou teas, possessing many of the characteristics
of Kin-tuck, to which it is closely allied. The dried leaf
varies considerably in style and appearance, some lots
having an evenly-curled and handsome leaf, while others
again are brownish and irregular; some of the earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>pickings possess a peculiar flavor termed “chocolate,”
for which they are much prized.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Kiu-kiang</span></b>—Comes from Hohow, one of the most
northern of the Moning districts, the quality of the finest
first pickings being simply superb. The dry leaf,
is black, uniform and free from dust, while the infused
leaf is bright-brown and very regular; but, with all these
advantages, they are lacking in strength or “snap” and
consequently are not of such value as their character on
first appearance would seem to indicate. They
deteriorate very rapidly, more so than any other of this
variety, and while the medium grades are a little fuller in
body, from the highest to the lowest the same want of
strength is found.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Panyong</span></b>—Is an exceedingly black, “silky” and
stylish leaf tea, rich, strong and mellow in the cup. The
finer grades corresponding in value and quality with those
of the same grades of Ning-chow, for which kind it may
be freely substituted in any emergency.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Hapyongs</span></b>—Are medium in size, fairly made and
pleasing in the hand, heavy, dark, smooth and fragrant
in the cup. While the infused leaf is dark, regular and
uniform, it is liable to be coarse and dark.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Paklin</span></b>—Is a large and important variety, not very
dissimilar to Ning-chow, but lacking in that roundness
and delicacy in the cup, for which the latter is so highly
valued. The dry-leaf of the finer grades is smaller,
more evenly twisted, and blacker than that of any other
grown in China. The infused leaf is bright-red, regular
and tender; the liquor is dark-red, and though
lacking in fulness the general cup qualities of the infusion
is of a very superior order.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Paklum</span></b>—While fuller and rounder in body than
Paklin, yields a sweet and pleasant liquor, but is inferior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>to that of the latter variety in flavor and aroma. The
dried leaf is also very black, fairly made and often
“tippy” in the hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some Congou teas are also produced in other districts
of China, being known to trade as Amoy, Ankoi, Qui-fa,
Padrae, Pekoe and Canton Congou teas.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Amoy Congou</span></b>—Known to trade also as “Swat-how,”
is invariably burnt in flavor, but when the crop is good,
is brisk and strong in the cup. The dry-leaf being coarse
and loosely folded, they deteriorate very rapidly, becoming
wild or “weedy” in flavor as they mature.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Qui-fa</span></b>—Is a “tarry” tea, allied to Amoy, but more
evenly curled and blacker in color. The liquor is
strong and brisk, and not quite as rank or bitter as that
of the former. The infused leaf is very coarse and
irregular in form, often broken and very dark in color.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Ankoi Congou<a id='tn087a'></a></span></b>—The difference between Ankoi and
Amoy Congou is not very wide, the former being ranker,
if anything. They are generally rougher in make, dull-black
in color, thick and muddy in the cup, bitter and
astringent in flavor, more particularly the commoner
grades, which are in addition broken, stemmy and dusty.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Padrae-Congou</span></b>—Is a strong, high-fired tea, large
in leaf, black and “crispy” in style, and useful only for
its great strength and pungency in the cup. The lower
grades are frequently “soapy” or “mousey” in flavor,
and invariably dusty<a id='tn087b'></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pekoe-Congou</span></b>—Approximates closest to Chingwo
in make and general appearance, but are more artistically
twisted and darker in color and “Pekoe-tipped,” the
flavor being sacrificed to style and finish. The infused
leaf is medium sized, regularly formed and reddish in
color, while the liquor is fairly rich, fragrant and pekoe-flavored
to a high degree.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span><b><span class='large'>Canton Congous</span></b>—Are principally manufactured teas,
being composed of exhausted leaves, <a id='tn088'></a>refired and faced
with plumbago, or other coloring-matter, and do not
contain the semblance of tea in the cup.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Campoi</span></b>—A corruption of the Chinese term <i>Chien-pei</i>,
or “Kampoey,” meaning “selected for firing;” is a particular
variety of Congou, smaller in leaf, darker in color
and much better curled, but not as dark in the infusion.
It possesses a more delicate flavor, is not as strong in body,
and being limited in quantity, but little is ever exported.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Bohea</span></b>—Is a term applied in China to a sort composed
of old, broken and inferior leaves, and the refuse of the
Congou kinds. It was formerly largely exported to
England, but is now retained chiefly for home consumption,
from its cheapness, by the poorer Chinese.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>NEW DISTRICT CONGOUS</h4>

<p class='c015'>comprise “Hoyunes,” “Tayshans,” “Cantons,” “Macaos,”
and many others new to commerce. The finer Hoyunes
are a brownish-grey leaf tea, varying in length and curl,
the finer grades of which are round and pungent, yielding
a deep-red liquor and bright-brown infused leaf. The
lower grades, however, are rough and irregular in make,
brownish in color and dull and harsh in flavor. Tayshans
and Macaos are among the newest makes of Congous
lately introduced, the former being prepared in imitation
of Moning and the latter of a Kaisow. Many of
the new makes, while flavory, are lacking in strength;
others again are strong almost to rankness. “Ho-how”
is the commonest of these descriptions of Congous, the
leaf being large and ragged and form “earthy,” and may
be termed the “Pingsuey” of this variety. There is
still another called “Kut-oan,” recently prepared as an
experiment from the leaf of a Green tea plant grown in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the Nankin district and said to be equal in every respect
to the finest Kaisow in leaf, liquor and flavor.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>SOUCHONG TEAS</h4>

<p class='c015'>are among the finest and richest of the Black tea sorts,
being known to the Chinese as <i>Saou-cheong</i>, “Little,” or
“scarce sort,” and are limited in supply. They are chiefly
prepared from the youngest leaves of the earliest pickings,
gathered only in the finest weather, and dried in the shade
to protect them from the direct rays of the sun. The dry
leaf is longer but thinner than that of the Congou sorts;
folded rather than curled or twisted, but possessing
somewhat similar drinking qualities. They are classed
in trade as Lapsing, Tong-quam, Padrae, Pekoe, Oolong,
and Canton Souchongs.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Lapsing</span></b>—Prepared in the district of <a id='tn089a'></a>Foochow, is
also known to trade as “<a id='tn089b'></a>Foochow-Souchong,” is a
large, handsome, crapy leaf, finely made and lightly fired,
possessing a rich, wine-colored liquor with fragrant flavor,
entirely peculiar to itself, described as “tarry flavor,”
which when not too pronounced adds rather than detracts
from its worth. The product of the later pickings are of
less strength and flavor, but are still very smooth and
pleasant in liquor and flavor, and generally shipped to
the Russian market, where they are held in high esteem
for their intrinsic qualities.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Oolong-Souchong</span></b>—Is another variety of the foregoing,
prepared from the leaves of a plant that cannot well
be made into either sort, the greatest care being taken in its
manipulation. It is stylish in leaf, closely approximating
to <a id='tn089c'></a>Foochow Oolong in the dried state, very clear, rich
and translucent in the infusion, but though light in
weight and color is yet very deceptive, being full of snap
and sparkle, fragrant and aromatic.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span><b><span class='large'>Tong-quam</span></b>—Is a long, flat, black-leaf Souchong tea
carefully folded, but little understood by the general
trade, owing to the liquor possessing nearly the same
flavor and pungency as that of a Red-leaf Congou,
usually more round and fuller, the dry leaf being slightly
bolder and blacker in appearance.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Padrae-Souchong</span></b>—Is a jet-black leaf, small and
“crapy” in texture, usually prepared from the youngest
and tenderest leaves of the Congou order, and which it
closely resembles in general character and flavor. The
dry leaf is, however, much smaller, flatter and darker, but
greatly excelling them in the delicacy and fragrance of
the infusion.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pekoe-Souchong</span></b>—Is prepared from the leaves that
have developed too much to be converted into the former
kind, which is small in size. The dry leaf is medium-sized,
very black and moderately “tipped” at the ends
with a whitish-downy substance termed “pekoe.” In
liquor they are strong, dark, pungent and fragrant in
flavor and aroma.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Canton Souchongs</span></b>—Are prepared from old and
exhausted leaves collected in a careless manner, exposed
in the sun to dry, and packed in baskets until they reach
that city, where they are refired, colored and scented in
order to disguise their bitter, rank and astringent
properties.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>SCENTED TEAS</h4>

<p class='c015'>form a special class of the Chinese product comprising
Capers, Pekoes and Pouchong teas, being known to trade
as Foochows, Cantons and Macaos.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Caper</span></b>—Known to the Chinese as He-choo-cha,
“Black pearl,” or Gunpowder, from its small, round or
spherical appearance, resembling capers. It is prepared
from the largest but most succulent leaves of the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>pickings, and cured by a series of brisk firings and rollings,
after which it is placed in moulds, in order to make it
retain its globular shape. The dried leaf is small, round
and “shotty” in appearance, reddish-black in color,
glossy and highly scented. The infusion is wine-colored,
piquant and aromatic, possessing what is technically
termed a rich “bouquet,” the infused leaf, when uncurled,
being very symmetrical in form and dark-brown in color.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pekoes</span></b>—From the Chinese <i>Pai-ho</i>, or <i>Pak-ho</i>, signifying
“white down,” is applied to a variety of tea having
a whitish downy or “silvery” tip at the end of the leaves.
It is usually prepared from the youngest and tenderest
leaf-buds first expanding, and was at one time claimed to
be composed of the flower or blossom of the tea plant,
hence its French name, “<i>fleur de thé</i>,” an error long since
corrected, as the tea blossom possesses none of the
properties of the leaf, though frequently used for scenting
purposes.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Orange-Pekoe</span></b>—Recognized by its long, flat, even
and artistically folded leaf, jet-black color, and yellowish
downy tips at the ends. It is highly scented, yielding a
rich wine-colored liquor, piquant, pungent and aromatic
in the cup, the infused leaf being small, bright and closely
resembling that of choicest Oolong variety.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Flowery-Pekoe</span></b>—Is a smaller but more evenly folded
leaf, greenish-black or olive-colored, with ends ornamented
by whitish, “velvety” tips, being also very highly
scented. The infusion is lighter in color and body but
piquant and aromatic in flavor, the infused leaf small,
dark and perfectly formed.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Hung-muey</span></b>—Is still another variety of Pekoe
rarely exported, having a plain black leaf lightly tipped
and lightly scented, and yielding an infusion dark in color,
thin in body, but very fragrant and aromatic in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span><b><span class='large'>Pouchong</span></b>—Derives its trade name from <i>Paou-cheong</i>,
meaning “wrapped sort.” The leaf is rough and bold
in style, dull-black in color and peculiar in scent. The
latter being imparted by the admixture of the seeds of
the <i>Lan-hoa</i>, or Chulan flower, the finer grades of which
are deep red, rich and pleasing, but the lower ones are
often abominable.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pouchong-Pekoe</span></b>—Is usually prepared from the
undeveloped leaves or just expanding buds of the tea
plant, and is a small, glossy-black leaf with yellowish-golden
tips, yielding an intensely rich liquor very piquant
and highly aromatic in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Padrae-Pouchong</span></b>—Is a medium-sized leaf, exceedingly
black in color and well folded. The liquor is dark,
full, round and aromatic in flavor, but light and thin in
body.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Canton Scented Teas</span></b>—Known to trade as <i>Congee</i>—“Lic”
or “made teas,” to a large extent being purchased
in the natural state, converted into Capers and Pekoes at
will, and doctored or scented up to a certain standard by
contract. They are much higher scented than Foochows,
but lacking in the properties of true tea, less pungent in
liquor and devoid of character or flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Macao Scented Teas</span></b>—Known also as “New district,”
are closely allied to Cantons in make, appearance and character
of scent. The dry leaf is somewhat larger and
darker in color, the flavor being dull and peculiar in the
infusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fragrance of Scented teas is not, as is generally
supposed, natural to them, but imparted by the admixture
of the flowers, blossoms, leaves, or oils extracted from
the seeds or roots of other plants, such as the Orange,
Jessamine, Chlorantus, Gardenia, and Oleo-fragrans. The
leaves and blossoms of the Iris, Curcunia, and oil of Bixa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>orelana being also extensively used. In some districts
the scenting material is added to the tea during the
firing process, and afterwards separated by sifting. It is,
however, more generally introduced into the tea after it
is prepared and ready for packing; one pound of leaves
or blossoms being the usual proportion to each hundred
pounds of tea. They are spread over the top of the tea
in the chest and allowed to remain for at least a day, or
until it becomes strongly impregnated by absorbing their
moisture, and then removed, the duration depending on
the character of the scenting employed, the scent increasing
after the tea is packed for export. But though
scenting in general is supposed to be confined to the
choicer grades of tea it is as often applied to the inferior
sorts, with the object of disguising or concealing their
defective or damaged condition, and imparting a pleasant
odor, a much larger quantity being used in the latter.
The scenting greatly modifies and improves the flavor,
however, without adding any pernicious or deleterious
substance to the tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Consumers not accustomed to using these varieties
erroneously imagine, from the dark color of the leaf and
liquor, that they are much stronger and more exciting
than that of the Oolong or Green tea sorts. While the
contrary is the case, it requiring one-third more leaf of
corresponding quality to yield an infusion of equal
strength than of Oolong or Green tea sorts. The “smoky”
and “tarry” flavors possessed by many of them, and for
which this variety is so remarkable, is due in a great
measure to the use of ill-made charcoal in firing and the
use of soft woods containing tar or pitch, such as fir and
pine, in its preparation. The worst feature about which
is that this “smokiness” and “tarriness” does not
develop until long after the teas have left China, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>are offered for sale. It is also a noticeable fact that
certain waters serve to bring out these peculiarities
more prominently than others, American waters in
particular.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>OTHER CHINESE VARIETIES.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Besides these numerous ordinary teas of commerce,
there are several other varieties cultivated in China, but
principally for home consumption and rarely if ever
exported, among which may be mentioned:—</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Suen-cha</span></b>—Or “Sweet tea,” made from the leaves of
a slender shrub growing in the western province of Sze-chuan,
and peculiar only to that section. The leaf is
large, thick and odorless in the green or natural state,
but when cured exhales a rare and peculiar odor, and
possesses a sweet, liquorice-like taste in the infusion, not
altogether pleasant.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Peh-Yuen-cha</span></b>—Or “White cloud tea,” prepared
from another rare species of the tea shrub found near the
summit of Mount Ombei in the same province and most
dissimilar in character and flavor from that of the regular
teas of commerce. It yields an aromatic infusion,
peculiar but palatable, and is chiefly used by pilgrims and
travelers in that country.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Mandarin Tea</span></b>—Is still another rare variety, seldom
if ever exported, its use being confined to the Mandarins
and aristocracy of China. The leaf is exceeding small,
dark, crisp and tender, lightly fired and highly scented,
commanding as high as fifteen dollars per pound in the
home market.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Brick Tea</span></b>—Is composed of the old leaves, stems,
siftings and sweepings of the Chinese tea hongs, ground
fine, moistened and compressed into shapes somewhat
larger than regular building bricks. It has nothing to
recommend it as a tea, being sold chiefly to the Mongols,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Tartars and other tribes of Central Asia, among whom
it also serves as a currency.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Tablet Tea</span></b>—Is a “new make” of tea recently introduced
in China, appearing for the first time in the trade
returns last year. It is prepared by machinery from the
best quality of tea-dust, formed by pressure alone into
small cakes in the form of tablets perfectly hard and
solid, resembling chocolate in make and appearance. It
is not, like “brick tea,” moistened by steam before being
compressed, and the flavor is not in any way impaired by
the process of manufacture. One of the chief advantages
claimed for this form of tea is that, being subjected to
heavy hydraulic pressure, all the cells are broken and
the properties of the tea are more easily and completely
extracted by the boiling water, thus effecting a
considerable saving in the quantity required for a given
amount of the beverage. Its principal market is Russia,
which took from China last year over 500,000 pounds
in the form of tablets.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Medicine Tea</span></b>—Is prepared from the coarse leaves
and stems of the ordinary tea plant, ground and mixed
with medicinal herbs, packed in bundles and used for
medicinal purposes among Asiatic tribes.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Log-tea</span></b>—Is also prepared from the ordinary teas of
commerce. It is a very inferior grade, prepared from the
stalks, packed in the shape of logs, weighing from 8 to 10
pounds, and wrapped in the leaves of the bambusa, and
packed in this manner from motives of economy and
freight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The total production of tea in China is unknown, and
can at best be only roughly estimated, and while we have
no certain means of ascertaining the quantity consumed
in that country itself, fair conclusion may be drawn from
the data at hand. Taking the population at 400 millions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and considering that the use of tea is universal among
its inhabitants, an average of five pounds <i>per capita</i>
would not be an overestimate, making a total of two billion
pounds alone for home consumption. Again averaging
the product at 100 pounds of cured tea per acre and the
total area under tea cultivation at 20 million acres, if,
therefore, we admit the home consumption of tea in
China to be two billion pounds, we cannot but be surprised
at the relatively small quantity which is exported
from that country. According to the latest statistics, we
find that the total exports to all countries from China
does not exceed 200 million pounds, which is less than
one-tenth of the total production of that country.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>JAPAN TEAS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Tea is grown for commercial purposes all over the
Japanese islands, from Kiusiu in the south to Niphon in
the north, but both in quantity and quality of their
product the central provinces of Hondo are the finest,
particularly that produced in the districts on the coast
provinces of the interior sea. The tea soil of Japan is
described as slate atmospherically dissolved with gypsum
and phosphoric acid, produced by manuring. The system
of cultivation and methods of preparation do not differ materially
from those of the Chinese, the first picking, which
is the best, occurring about the beginning of May, the
second a month later, the third is often, however, omitted
altogether, in order not to injure the plants. In Japan the
raw leaves are generally sold to the exporters, by whom
they are prepared and converted into the several descriptions
known to commerce.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a sufficient quantity has been accumulated they
are carried to the hong or “drying house” and first placed
in large bamboo baskets, in which they are subjected to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>steam bath for about a minute, after which process they are
spread out in the open air to cool and dry thoroughly,
previous to being fired and curled. Only about five
pounds of the leaves are put in the pans at a time for
manipulation, the process being identical with that of
China, with the exception that they are finally dried in
bamboo baskets suspended over the furnaces by cords
from the ceiling for about fifteen minutes. During this
time they are gently agitated by the hands of the
operators in order to diffuse the heat and more thoroughly
dry them. They are then removed by a dextrous motion
with fan-like scoops and tossed in the air to free them
from dust and stems, and afterwards picked over by
women and children before packing in the lead-lined
chests for export.</p>

<p class='c009'>In color, flavor and character, Japan teas are totally
distinct from any and all other varieties, the finer grades
being exceedingly delicate, rich and peculiar to themselves.
They yield a light-colored liquor, very fragrant in flavor,
but apt to deceive the casual drinker, as after continued
use they are found to possess greater strength and pungency
than most China teas, their effect on the nervous
system being very soon perceptible. They are classed
commercially as Yama-shiro, Uji, Kioto, Yedo, Eisyie,
Suringar, Hatchoji, Nagahama, Nagasaki, Tosia and
Bancha, grading in value in the order named, and converted
into Pan-fired, Sun-dried, Basket-fired, Nibs and
Siftings, with occasionally small lots of Pekoe, Congou,
Oolong, Imperial, Gunpowder and Young Hyson makes.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pan-fired</span></b>—The finer grades have a long, well-curled,
natural green leaf, presenting an unbroken appearance,
sinking immediately to the bottom of the cup on infusion,
uncurling rapidly and showing more or less perfect leaves
in the infused state. It yields a clear, bright liquor, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>remains unchanged in color and flavor until cold. The
flavor is delicate and fragrant in odor somewhat like
that of new-mown hay. The medium grades are correspondingly
rougher in make, darker in liquor and duller in
flavor, while the commoner ones are coarse and unsightly
in style, varying from a greenish to a mottled blue in
color, and possessing a “brassy” or metallic taste, due to
the cosmetic or artificial coloring-matter used in their
preparation.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Sun-dried</span></b>—As the name implies, are steamed and
dried in the sun before firing, in order to fix their color
permanently. The leaf is olive-green, well fired, compactly
curled and “toasty” in the cup, owing to their
thorough fermentation before firing, and although not as
well appreciated as the Pan-fired, are much superior in
drinking properties, their extra fermentation destroying
the “grassy” flavor so characteristic of many Japans.
The lower grades range from a yellowish to a dull-green,
indifferently rolled and often “fishy” in flavor, said to
be contracted from the use of fish manure in the coast
districts.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Basket-fired</span></b>—So named from being cured by the
“basket process,” and in contradistinction to those fired
in pans. The finer grades are long, dark and exceedingly
well twisted or curled, entirely free from stems, dust and
other extraneous matter, clear and bright in liquor, and
mellow or “mealy” in flavor, the latter quality making
them a very valuable sort for blending purposes. The
commoner grades are rough, and uncouth in style,
brownish-black in color, thick and heavy in liquor, but
lacking in “grip” and flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Kumo</span></b>—Or “Spider-leg” Japan, is in reality only a finer
grade of basket-fired; long, narrow, black, and “wirey”
in leaf, and elastic in texture. It is of the Pekoe order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>in make, but still retaining all the properties of liquor and
flavor of a Japan tea pure and simple.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Nibs</span></b>—Are composed of the refuse of the foregoing
kinds, bearing the same relation to Japans that
Twankays do to Green teas, many of them drawing and
drinking exceedingly well, according to the grade separated
from.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to 1856 China tea was the only tea used in the
United States, but during that year a small quantity of
Japan teas, consisting of about 50 half-chests, was first
received in this country. Being found pure and free from
coloring-matter, it soon became very popular with consumers,
a large number of whom had been prejudiced
against China green teas at the time, under the impression
that they were more or less artificially colored.
The demand steadily increased, 400 half-chests were imported
the following year, which was increased to 1,100
chests in 1859. About 1860 the Japanese changed their
mode of curing, adopting that of the Chinese as applied
to Green teas, with the result of altering the color from
a dark to a light green, and of imparting a high “toasty”
or malty flavor, in lieu of the uncooked or “grassy”
taste which characterized the first importations, since
which period and change they have continued to grow
in popular favor. But the supply of Japan teas being at one
time greatly in excess of the demand and the price declining
in many instances below the cost of production, in connection
with the fact that the teas as originally prepared were
used only in the American market, induced the Japanese
to convert their surplus leaf into other varieties, such as
Pekoes, Congous, Oolongs, Imperials, Gunpowders, and
Young Hysons, in imitation of the Chinese “makes,” with
the futile expectation of popularizing them in England and
other countries, where, heretofore, only very small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>quantities were consumed. With this intention Chinese
skilled labor was imported into the tea districts to aid them
in the experiment of preparing these makes of teas.
The result proved most unsatisfactory as was anticipated
at the time by experts and others interested in the
project, only very small quantities of the respective kinds
being produced occasionally. It is predicted, however,
that all the different descriptions now received from other
countries will be eventually prepared in Japan, in evidence
of which a tea rivalling the finest Formosa in general
character is now produced in the Hondo district from a
variety of the Japan plant.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Japan Pekoe</span></b>—Is a long, dark-green, flat leaf tea,
usually “tipped,” but as often not, approaching to that
of the India variety in style and appearance. But
while looking remarkably well in the hand and up to
standard in drink, being smooth in liquor and “malty”
in flavor, as a general rule it is through overfiring lacking
in the scent and aroma of the China and even India prototype.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Japan Congou</span></b>—Approximates in many of its leading
features to that of the India species, the cured leaf possessing
similar properties to many of the finer grades of
the latter. The infusion is brighter in color but thinner
in body, and more acidulous in flavor, and the reverse of
palatable, owing to its imperfect fermentation and high
or overfiring.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Japan Oolongs</span></b>—Although cured in identically the
same manner as the China variety, resemble them only
in general contour. The leaf is darker in color but finer
in make, approaching more to the Souchong order. The
infusion is also darker in draw, but very “toasty,” that is,
“burnt” in flavor, owing to too high firing, retaining
all the original peculiarities of a regular Japan tea.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span><b><span class='large'>Japan Imperials, Gunpowders and Young Hysons</span></b>—Differ
only from the ordinary Japan teas in form,
make and color. Being prepared from the same leaf,
they naturally possess the same general characteristics
and cup qualities; the demand not justifying, they are not
produced in any appreciable quantities.</p>

<p class='c009'>The production of tea in Japan is constantly increasing
and its quality improving, a wider area being devoted to
its cultivation each year, largely superseding sericulture
in many districts. The total area now under cultivation
amounts to nearly 42,000 <i>Cho</i>, or about 100,000 acres.
The total annual product is estimated at 100,000,000
pounds, a gain of over 30,000,000 as compared with
1890, of which 40,000,000 pounds, or 44 per cent. of the
total production was consumed in the United States
during the fiscal year of 1891. The American taste for
Japan teas continues to grow in proportion, particularly
in the Northwestern and Pacific States, their consumption
in this country nearly doubling that of Oolongs and
Congous combined, and trebling that of Green teas of
all makes. This too, notwithstanding the fact that only
a very small proportion of really choice Japan teas are
ever exported, rarely exceeding one per cent. of the
entire crop, being principally retained for home consumption.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>INDIA TEAS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>One of the most remarkable circumstances in connection
with the development of the Tea trade is the rapid
increase in the production and consumption of India Teas.
Almost unknown to commerce thirty years ago, they
are fast becoming an important factor in the business,
particularly in the English and colonial markets,
India being already of such importance to them as a
source of tea supply that it is only a question of a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>short time when the tea consumers of these countries
will no longer regard China as a tea-growing country
indispensable to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>As far as can be ascertained, the first announcement
of the discovery of the tea-plant in India was made in
1833, but owing to imperfect specimens being sent to
botanists for inspection, it was not at the time considered
a true species. It was fully demonstrated, however, in
1835, when a plant with perfect leaves, flowers and seeds
was obtained which proved on analysis to be a species
of the genus tea allied to, but not identical with that of
China; Burmese and Chinese experts, to whom the specimens
were submitted, concurring in the statement.
The report being favorable, an experimental plantation
was immediately established under government auspices
with results not known. The first plantation for its cultivation
on a commercial scale was formed in Lukhimpore
in 1836, from which the first samples were received
in 1839, and the first sales made in 1840. But, owing
to the unfavorable reports given on the first samples of
the tea prepared from the India leaf, it was rejected by
the London brokers. The propriety of introducing the
China species was next suggested by some planters, and
tons of seed were at once imported from that country, large
estates being formed from the plants raised from it.
Many of the plantations were finally composed of
hybrids or crosses between the China and India species,
which is now claimed to have been an error, as the
nearer each variety approaches to the indigenous the
higher its excellence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tea-producing districts of India are widely scattered,
the largest—Assam—being situated in the extreme northeast
of the country bordering on the Burmese Empire,
the others being located on the northwestern boundary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>of Nepaul and the Punjaub, while Central India
appears to be entirely devoid of tea gardens up to
the present. There are numerous plantations, however,
scattered over the southwestern provinces of the peninsula,
most notably in Wynaad, Neilgherry and Travancore.
In India, tea is grown on extensive estates, often comprising
thousands of acres, situated principally in the
alluvial valleys of large rivers, or formed on land
reclaimed from primeval jungle, possessing all the richness
of virgin soil and cultivated either by the individual
owners or the agents of companies commanding considerable
capital. Every detail of cultivation and preparation
is conducted under close and careful European supervisors.
The plants are raised from seed sown in nurseries
until they are about 18 inches high, when they are
transplanted to the rows in the gardens in which they
are to grow, the closest attention being paid to weeding
and irrigating. The young trees are carefully pruned
periodically and reduced to a bushy form, until they are
from two to three years old, when the first picking commences,
the exact time for picking being determined by
the overseer. The leaves are removed in such a manner
as to cause no subsequent injury to the plants, by
which care the India planter is enabled to obtain from
twelve to sixteen pickings in a single season, the
Chinese grower being limited to three or four at the
utmost.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each separate picking in India is termed a “Flush,” a
number of flushes constituting a “Break” or “Chop,” as
in China, which is rarely more than 100 chests and frequently
as low as 20, but generally uniform in grade.
There is another remarkable feature about India teas; it
is that while the first, second and third pickings of all
other teas are respectively inferior to each other there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>is nothing in the India pickings to denote their relationship
to any crop or gathering. The number of pickings
from the India plant also varies considerably according
to the soil, situation, garden and season. When all these
conditions are favorable, the plantation will yield as
many as sixteen “flushes,” while ordinarily and often
under the most unfavorable conditions five to six are
obtained in a single season.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no radical difference between the Chinese and
Indian methods of preparation up to what is termed
the “Rolling process;” it being performed in the latter
country very lightly and only by a minimum of pressure
by machinery. Each day’s collection is immediately
“withered” until thoroughly evaporated, when they
are as promptly cured and fired. The processes of
fermenting and firing are not as detailed or complete
as in China, the India planter aiming to secure
the component properties of a <i>strong tea</i> at the
expense of <i>flavor</i> and keeping qualities. In India
the tea is generally prepared from the young shoots,
two leaves only being picked at a time and “withered”
in the open air without any extraneous aid, much,
however, depending on the skill and knowledge of
the operators in arresting the process at the exact
moment. When the proper point is reached they are
immediately removed to a “drying” room, and laid
out on trays until the excessive moisture has been
dissipated, this process being hastened by occasional
blasts of hot air driven through by a machine. When
sufficient moisture has been extracted they are placed in
a heavy rolling machine and tossed about until all the
cellular tissues are broken, when they begin to curl up
tightly, as if by the action of the hand, after which they
are placed in heaps on tables for some hours to allow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>them to ferment; the color, meanwhile, changing from
green to a dark bronze during the process.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the process of “firing” the leaves are spread out in
a series of wire-gauze trays, placed in layers in a hot-air
machine, known as a “Sirocco,” from the fact that the
current of vapor arising from it is suggestive of the hot
winds of the desert, and in which the temperature averages
some 300 degrees. These screens are operated
either in a lateral or rotary direction also by steam, the
tea being thoroughly fired in from twenty to twenty-five
minutes, and separated into the different grades at the
same time. But on some plantations the tea is afterwards
bulked in large tin-lined cases until a considerable quantity
is accumulated, when it is again lightly fired, the
operations of sorting and grading being again performed
by machinery previous to being packed in the
teak-wood chests, in which it is finally shipped. The
curing and firing of tea by hot air and machinery in
India is fast superseding the primitive arrangements
and charcoal processes so long in use in China. Yet
though much more rapid and effective in its work, and
certain not to taint the leaves in any manner, it is still an
open question whether the older and slower methods
of curing in pans over charcoal fires is not after all
the better one. That the teas are not properly cured
or thoroughly fired by this over-hasty method is
evidenced by the fact that India teas in general are
noted for their great excess of tannin and peculiar
raw, “grassy,” uncooked or herby flavor. But labor
and fuel-saving machinery are effecting such economy
in the cultivation and preparation of tea in India as to
yearly reduce the cost of its production. So many
improvements for drying, rolling, firing and sorting
are annually being recorded that it is difficult even to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>estimate at what figure it may be produced there in the
future.</p>

<p class='c009'>India teas comprise Assams, Cachars, Darjeelings,
Deradoons, Kumaons, Dooars, Chittagongs, Juligoories,
Rangworths and Neilgherries, district terms, ranking in the
order named, and are converted into Pekoes, Souchongs,
<a id='tn106'></a>Pekoe-Souchongs, Congous, Broken-leaf and Fannings.
In make, style, color, flavor, and general appearance,
India teas resemble most the Congou sorts of China, but
many of them being produced from a combination of the
China and India plants are hybrid in character, differing
essentially from either originals. Most of them possess
a sharp, acrid taste, not to be found in any other variety,
and a peculiar flavor rarely liked by consumers, unless
when tempered with the softer and more mellow China
growths, and to neutralize which peculiarity it is at all
times necessary to use only the best India grades. In
make they are in general longer and narrower in leaf,
darker in color, more shapely, better curled or twisted, and
finer in texture than the corresponding Chinese varieties.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Assams</span></b>—Are greyish-black in color, the leaf of the
finer grades being “Pekoe-tipped” and evenly curled.
The liquor is unusually strong and pungent, in addition
to being thick and heavy in body. The infused leaf
dark-brown, with a reddish tinge, and almost perfect
in form.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Cachars</span></b>—Are blacker in color, but not as well curled
or even in appearance. The liquor is softer and occasionally
“fruity,” approaching a burnt flavor, while the
infused leaf is larger, darker and not as finely shaped.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Darjeeling</span></b>—Is a hybrid variety, produced from a
cross between the China and India species, and partaking
somewhat of the character of both. It is still
blacker in the dry leaf, but on an average not as finely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>curled, and while full in body is not as pungent or flavory
in the cup. The infused leaf is more bright, tender,
shapely and “salmony” red in color.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Kangras</span></b>—As a rule are dark and symmetrical in leaf,
light in liquor, but delicate and aromatic in flavor. The
infused leaf is reddish-brown in color, with dark or burnt
edges, but perfect in shape and form.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Deradoon</span></b>—Is a high-fired tea, loosely made and deteriorating
rapidly, becoming sour on exposure to the air.
Occasionally the flavor is “earthy,” analagous to that of
Ankoi Oolong, for which reason they are not much sought
after.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Kumaon</span></b>—Is generally converted into Green teas,
including Imperials, Gunpowders, and Hysons, all being
prepared from the same leaf. The chief difference lies
in their make and color, as they still retain all the
characteristics of liquor and flavor of India teas.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Chittagongs</span></b>—Are strong, thick and heavy in the cup;
“nutty” in flavor and considered good, useful teas for
blending purposes, from their great strength and positive
character, for which qualities they are always in good
demand.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Dooars</span></b>—Approximate to Cachars in color, make and
general appearance, strong, but rough in liquor, pungent
and pleasing in flavor, a valuable tea for blending, imparting
tone and character to any combination in which they
may be used.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Neilgherry</span></b>—Is a very inferior sort, bearing the same
relation to India teas that Ankois do to Oolongs and
Pingsueys to Green teas. The leaf in general is black,
coarse, “tippy,” rough and unsightly in the hand, while
the liquor is thin, muddy and rank or “weedy” in
flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span><b><span class='large'>Travancore</span></b>—Is a “new district” tea, which, like all
new teas, is large and coarse in leaf, heavy and dark in
liquor, and strong and wild or “grassy” in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Juligoorie and Rangworths</span></b>—Are bold in style,
rather rough in make, but regular and well developed.
The liquor is thick and rich in color, rough or “rasping”
in flavor, but occasionally smooth and “toasty,” while
the infused leaves are bright and well formed as a rule.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>SUB-VARIETIES OF INDIA TEA.</h4>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>India Pekoes</span></b>—Are ordinarily of a greyish-black hue,
with a fair sprinkling of grayish-yellow tips, downy in
appearance, while the liquor is very strong, brisk and
pungent, varying in quality and flavor according to the
district of production.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Orange-Pekoe</span></b>—Is a small, evenly-curled leaf, having
a yellowish or golden “tip” at the ends. In liquor and
flavor it approximates close to plain Pekoe, being
devoid of scent, that many growers make no distinction
between them.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Flowery-Pekoe</span></b>—Is not picked from the plant, but
separated from the other grades, only the buds and
youngest leaves being selected. The cured leaf is small,
uniform and tender, silvery-green in color, although highly-fired,
pale but strong in liquor, approaching that of a
Moyune Green in flavor, being very deceptive in strength
and astringency. The infused leaf is symmetrical in form,
small and light-green in color, approaching that of a
Foochow Oolong in appearance in the cup.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Souchong</span></b>—Forms the bulk of the India product and
may be classed as the “Standard grade;” the qualifications
for being comprehended under this rating are its even,
straight, slightly curled leaf, dark color, stylish appearance
and greater quantity. Yet while its liquor does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>possess the deep strength and pungency of the Pekoe
sorts, it is generally full and round in body and mellow
or “malty” in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pekoe-Souchong</span></b>—Is a term applied to Pekoe leaves
devoid of tips, as well as to Souchong containing a
fair sprinkling of tipped leaves. But, as a general
rule, it is an unassorted tea, composed principally of
the larger and coarser leaves of both Pekoe and
Souchong that will not pass through the sieves, and
possessing in the cup the distinctive properties of the
combination.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>India Congou</span></b>—Is a tea of the Souchong order too
large to be made into that kind or a smaller leaf unevenly
prepared. In liquor and flavor it is much the same as
Souchong, but is not always as heavy, strong or mellow
in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Broken-leaf</span></b>—As its name implies, is composed of a
mixture of the various kinds broken in manipulation, and
is a term of great comprehensiveness, as it may include
all the lower grades or approach the choicest kinds in
character and value. It varies in color from brown to
blackish, its strength being seldom great, though the
flavor of the finer grades is, in general, good; that of the
commoner ones being poor, thin and coarse.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>India Bohea</span></b>—Consists chiefly of the old and coarser
leaves which do not attain a desirable black color in firing,
being devoid of sap. The leaf is generally brown, sometimes
yellowish in color, the liquor possessing scarcely
any strength, usually coarse and rough in flavor, and
never of much value at any time.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Fannings</span></b>—Are composed of the refuse, much broken
leaves and dust of all the preceding kinds, and bear the
same relation to India teas that Twankays do to Green
and Nibs to Japan teas.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span><b><span class='large'>Namuna</span></b>—In Hindostanee literally means “Sample,”
being accidentally applied to a class of India tea, possessing
great strength and high, peculiar flavor not confined
to any particular district or plantation. The dry leaf may
have the regular grayish-black hue, or be of a greenish-black
color, the green leaves being intermixed and distinct
from the black ones. It invariably yields a pale, corn-yellow
colored liquor, resembling that of Oolong, heavier
and stronger than ordinary Pekoe, and in flavor like a
Moyune, yet distinct from the former and not as pungent
as the latter. Frequently, however, it is intermingled
with a nasty black leaf, the flavor of which is destroyed
by over-firing, the green leaves being due to deficient or
under-firing.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are many serious objections to the general use
of India teas, one of which is the great excess of <i>tannin</i>
(tannic acid) which they contain, ranging from 13 to 18
per cent. in this variety, and to which property tea owes
its astringency, constipating effect on the bowels and the
ink-black color which it imparts to water containing salts
of iron. In England a crusade is being preached against
their use by medical authorities on this account, the
marked increase in dyspeptic and nervous diseases in
that country being attributed to their general consumption
there. Some experts argue that by a shorter infusion—sufficiently
long to extract the theine with less of
the tannin—this serious defect may be eventually
remedied. Such, however, is not the case, as experiments
made with it at three and five minute infusions
have still shown an excess of tannin, in addition to that
of making the liquor raw, herby, and entirely unsatisfactory
in flavor. The same time-tests resulting in favor
of both China and Japan teas, and which, judging by the
bitterness and astringency, the amount of tannin yielded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>by India teas in a five-minute draw is incredible. While
China teas, under the same conditions, possesses little or
no trace of tannic acid, or offending the most sensitive
palate or constitution, but on the contrary being both
pleasing and refreshing to the most sensitive natures.
Another distinct and dubious feature of India teas is the
formation of a gummy or oily film which settles on top
of the infusion when drawn, and claimed to be very
injurious to the nervous system and digestive organs.
When first infused this substance is scarcely discernible,
but just as soon as the liquor begins to cool this opaque
coating forms and develops on top. It is of an oily,
creamy or gummy nature, forming a thin layer of a dull,
whitish-brown color, more dense than the liquor and
changing to a darker shade as it cools. Its nature or
effect has not yet been definitely determined, but
sufficient is known to prove that it is particularly
unwholesome, for their selection is also more difficult than
that of any other variety owing to their well-known
tendency to early decay, becoming sour and rancid on
short exposure to the oxydizing influences of the atmosphere,
the greatest caution having to be exercised in
avoiding those that will not keep for any length of time
owing to this most objectionable peculiarity, losing flavor
quicker and decaying faster than any other kinds, not
even excepting low-grade Japans. This loss of flavor and
rapid decay is greater in some sorts than in others, the
grades most easily affected in this manner being the
highly-fired, light-flavored and open-leaf makes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The demand for India teas in this country is only
limited, owing to the present taste of consumers, and
there appears little hope of any increase in the future.
What little is sold being used chiefly for blending with
the softer and more mellow-flavored teas of China; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>India grades supplying the absent quality of strength
to the latter. Strenuous efforts have and are being made
to introduce them, but so far with indifferent success.
The character of the liquor after the infusion is so entirely
foreign in body, color, flavor and aroma from that of the
China and Japan sorts to which the people have been
accustomed, and which appears to be an inherited taste,
so deeply is it set, that little or no progress can be made
in these attempts. The great strength, pungency and
pronounced flavor of the choicer grades rendering them
valuable only for blending purposes. Still it is difficult
to overestimate the importance of India as a source of
tea supply. Twenty years ago it furnished only about
10,000,000 pounds to the world’s supply, but so rapidly
has its production increased that the crop for 1892 is
estimated at 110,000,000 pounds. Its consumption in
England is annually increasing, the total deliverance
for that year being 103,000,000 pounds as against
99,000,000 pounds for 1890, while for 1889 the increase
was upwards of 12,000,000 pounds over that of 1888.
These enormous strides in the consumption of India teas
in England is only equalled by that of Ceylon teas, the
British public demanding strong, dark liquoring teas
irrespective of flavor, aroma or effect.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CEYLON TEAS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The tea-plant, though claimed to have been first introduced
into Ceylon by the English, who, on principle,
“claim everything,” was originally carried by the Dutch
from China to that island as early as 1800, notwithstanding
that Percival maintains that it was first discovered
there in a wild state. But while it is admitted
that a species known as <i>Matara</i> was found in some parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>of the island, later investigation proved that it had no
relation whatever to that of the regular teas of commerce.
Tennant, in 1842, was the first Englishman to
speak of Ceylon as a possible tea-growing country, but
the highly profitable cultivation of coffee at that time
attracted so much public attention that the article which
has since proved to be the real wealth of the island was
heedlessly overlooked, so that it is not too much to say
that the present high position of Ceylon as a tea-producing
country has been to a great extent entirely due
to accident, it being only after the outbreak of the coffee-pest
in 1870 that tea was first looked upon as a possible
source of profit. When utter ruin seemed the only fate
of the planters, it was suggested that they turn their
attention to the cultivation of tea. A commission was
duly appointed to visit the tea districts of India, and
report upon the desirability of introducing the tea-plant
into Ceylon. Very tardily, indeed, at first did the planters
come to regard the experiment in the light of a paying
speculation, for old habits and prejudices were strong,
inducing them to cling with persistency to the hope that
the coffee-plague would ultimately disappear, and it was
only as a last resource that they decided to turn their
attention to tea-culture on that island. The first plantation
was started with plants received from China; the
result, however, proved a financial failure, the first tea
produced therefrom costing $25 per pound. Other spasmodic
efforts were made later, until it was finally admitted
that tea-culture could be made a success on the island,
when a rush was made for estates for tea-growing purposes.
The progress made was small at the beginning,
many of those who planted tea doing so under the conviction
that the industry would not pay, abandoning the
scheme almost at the outset.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Ceylon eventually began its career as a tea-growing
country under the most favorable circumstances; all the
mythical hallucinations about tea cultivation having been
removed, the disastrous experience of India saving Ceylon
from falling into any serious error at the outset. Several
India planters settled on the island, bringing with them a
knowledge of its proper cultivation and preparation, so
that when these facts are taken into consideration, the
success which has attended its cultivation in Ceylon is
not so much to be wondered at. The island also possessed
other advantages over India in that it suffers less
from drought, the rains are more regular and equable,
there being scarcely a month in the year without at least
some rain, and apart from the adaptability of its soil and
climate, it has cheaper labor and superior facilities for
forwarding the tea to the shipping ports, all important
factors in its cultivation for profit. The tea-producing
districts of the island are very compact, having Kandy as
its chief centre and extending well into the southwestern
provinces touching the coast toward the west. The
southwestern section of the island is considered a perfect
tea-growing district, soil is good, the climate hot and
moist, and the plant can be cultivated at almost any
elevation, several plantations there being situated as high
as 6,000 feet above sea-level. But although the crops
are fairly healthy at this altitude, it is admitted that the
plantations lower down are best adapted for the production
of the finer grades. The first successful garden was
established in 1870 in the now celebrated Loocandura
estate, with plants brought from Calcutta, and coolies
skilled in its cultivation and manipulation. Tea of particularly
good quality was produced from the beginning,
samples of which were sent to London and
highly spoken of by dealers there. Since that time tea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>cultivation in Ceylon has made steady progress if not
rapid strides.</p>

<p class='c009'>The plant chiefly grown in Ceylon is a hybrid—the
<i>Manipur</i> or indigenous tea of Manipari (India)—is also
extensively planted there, being equally hardy and suitable
to the soil of the island, which is of a light, sandy
nature, thickly intermixed with iron-sandstone, this mineral
being peculiarly attractive to the tea-plant. The
methods of cultivation and preparation are similar in
every respect to those in vogue in India. The land is
carefully drained and weeded, the trees are not allowed
to grow too high, being reduced to a bushy form and
picked when they are from two to three years old,
according to site and elevation, and the tea prepared from
the tender shoots only, caution being exercised not to
injure the plants or future flushes checked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Picking the leaf is carried on all the year round in
Ceylon, except during pruning time, when the plants do
not “flush” for two months, with which exception they
flush every week, from each shoot of which the two top-leaves
with the young shoot and half the third or coarser
leaf are only plucked at a time. At 4 o’clock each
evening the day’s “picking” is carried to the factory and
the leaves laid out on the “withering” mats, which are
stretched one above the other from poles or racks until
the next morning, when the leaf is sufficiently evaporated,
being rendered soft, pliable, and easy to roll by that time.
The next process, that of “Rolling,” is one to which
special attention is paid, as it is mainly to this system
that the quality of the tea depends. The previously
withered leaves are put into the roller, which is operated
by hand or steam power, 100 pounds at a time placed
in an upper box of the machine and pressed down with
weights on the table or lower portion of the machine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The box containing the pressed tea travels with a circular
motion round the table, by which the leaves are
pressed, twisted and rolled as they come in contact with
the small battens fitted into the centre of the table.
After an hour the pressure is increased until at the
finish it is from four to five hundred pounds on the
leaves, the juice thus expressed being carefully collected
and poured back into the roller every now and again
until it is all absorbed by the crushed and twisted mass
of leaves. When the rolling process is finished, the
leaves are then placed on trays holding from 20 to 25
pounds, covered with a wet cloth and allowed to ferment
from two to four hours according to the weather, or
until they become a bright-copper color, when they are
again rolled from a half to an hour according to fancy,
after which they are ready for firing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “Sirocco machine” for firing tea-leaves by hot air
has also superseded the pan or “Charcoal process” in
Ceylon. The leaves having been laid out on wire-gauze
trays, they are passed through this “hot-air” machine,
in which they become thoroughly fired Tea in from
twenty to twenty-five minutes, after which it is placed
in sieves, which are worked either in a lateral or revolving
direction by the aid of steam or manual power, and
the different grades are sifted out, the larger and coarser
leaves which do not pass through the sieves falling into
a “cutter,” where they are cut to a uniform size. On
estates where they bulk the Tea, in Ceylon, the result<a id='tn116'></a>
of the day’s work is placed in enormous air-tight lead-lined
chests, where it remains until a sufficient quantity
to form a “Break” or “Chop” is accumulated, which is
generally once per week. The chest is then opened
from the bottom and the tea bulked, after which it is
lightly fired again and packed into the teak-wood chests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>for shipment. Light iron chests, coated inside and out
with lead, and a lid to screw on, are now being extensively
used by many estates for the better shipment of
teas in both India and Ceylon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ceylon teas derive their trade names from the estates
or plantations on which they are grown, being classed
commercially as “Loocanduris,” “Matagalas,” “Ruan-wallas,”
“Kanda-loyas,” “Semba-watties,” “Windsor
Forests,” “Narangallas,” “Rakuwana,” “Madulsuma”
and “Kandapole,” the finest being produced in the districts
of Dunbula and Dolosbagie. Like India teas, they
are principally converted into Pekoes, Souchongs, Pekoe-Souchongs,
Congous, Broken-leaf, and Fannings. Their
strength and flavor, like those of their India prototypes,
varying greatly in quality in accordance with the elevation
at which they are grown, their uniformity also varying
from year to year as in the India districts. Some of
the better grades resemble Cachars and Darjeelings,
being full and strong in liquor, but frequently “toasty”
or burnt in flavor, while the lower grades are decidedly
inferior to the corresponding China grades in flavor and
fragrance. A feature about the later shipments most
to be regretted is that the planters appear to be making
the same mistake that the Chinese and Japanese have
made, that of sacrificing quality to quantity in their
eagerness to get rich too fast.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Ceylon-Pekoes</span></b>—Are of three kinds, “Plain,” “Silver,”
and “Golden-tip” Pekoes. The former is a small,
plain black-leaf tea, lightly “tipped” and finely made.
The liquor is bright and fairly heavy in body and fragrant
so far as this term applies to this variety, but is not
adapted to the American taste.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Silver-tip Pekoe</span></b>—Is a long, whitish-downy leaf
almost “satiny” in texture, with silvery tips at the ends.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>The liquor is dark-yellow or golden, bright and sparkling
in the cup, delicate and fragrant in flavor, but very
much overrated in commercial value and intrinsic merit.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Golden-tip Pekoe</span></b>—Is smaller in make, darker in
color, “silky” in texture, and literally ablaze with rich
yellow or orange tips. The infusion is much darker and
heavier in body, of a deep wine color, fresh and piquant
in taste, and much appreciated by those who prefer this
variety.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Ceylon Souchong</span></b>—Is rather large and bold in style
for this “make” of tea, but is nevertheless heavy and
round in body, rich and mellow in flavor, and, taken
altogether, a pleasing and palatable tea for all practical
purposes.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pekoe-Souchong</span></b>—Is chiefly composed of the larger
and coarser leaves that will not pass through the sieves,
but which, falling into the “cutter” in sifting, are cut
up into an even and uniform size. It is medium in size,
“choppy” in appearance, ripe and rich in liquor, fairly
brisk and “malty” in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Ceylon Congous</span></b>—Are open, rough and coarse in
style, dark in liquor, heavy in body, but fairly brisk and
pungent in flavor, making, on the whole, a serviceable
tea for blending with Chinese Congous or Oolongs of
the lower grades.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>“Bhud” Tea</span></b>—Is a term applied to a small golden-yellow
leaf Ceylon Tea, claimed to be composed of the
buds of the plant just expanding, but is in reality prepared
from the smallest and yellowest leaves of the ordinary
“Golden-tip Pekoe,” and though sometimes commanding
a fabulously high and inflated price, out of all
reason with its intrinsic value as a tea, and which is only
done for advertising purposes—being in reality no better
in either drawing or drinking qualities.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><b><span class='large'>Broken Leaf</span></b>—Like those of the India variety, are
composed of the large, old and mutilated leaves separated
in sifting from all or either of the foregoing kinds,
drawing and drinking in ratio to the variety obtained
from.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Fannings</span></b>—Also, like their Indian prototype, are prepared
from the screenings and refuse of leaves of the
respective kinds, but are poor teas to handle as a rule.</p>

<p class='c009'>As late as 1873 there were only 255 acres under tea
cultivation in Ceylon, the total area at present time reaching
as high as 150,000 acres, with an average yield of
1,000 pounds per acre, figures which go to show the
marvelous strides the island has made in the industry
in a comparatively few years, large tracts being still
taken up for the purpose. The total product in 1888
was 23,000,000 pounds, as against 13,000,000 pounds for
the previous year, an increase of 10,000,000 pounds in a
single year, a record never even approached in the history
of the tea trade. And, when it is taken into consideration
that it is only a few years since tea cultivation
was practically commenced on that island, it is obvious
that the future of its product must be very bright indeed.
It is already predicted by planters and others
interested that the tea export of Ceylon will eventually
rival, if not exceed, that of India itself. The average
cost of Tea to the Ceylon producers is about 6½ pence
(13 cents) per pound, some of the lowland estates putting
their teas f. o. b. in Colombo at even less than this
figure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nearly all the India and Ceylon teas go into consumption
in England and her possessions, the bulk of her
China purchases being re-exported. The English merchants
invariably favoring the products of their own colonies
to the prejudice of those of other countries, discriminating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>against them, irrespective of merit or value,
in this particular instance compelling their customers, in
a measure, to use these dubious varieties of the genus
tea. But for presumption and audacity in their claims
of superiority the India and Ceylon tea growers and
dealers are far and away ahead of all competition. The
so-called great favor with which India and Ceylon teas
are said to be regarded by British consumers being due
in a great measure to the energy and persistency with
which the trade has been pushed, the teas being literally
<i>forced</i> on the public by the Government as well as by
the English growers and dealers, in addition to the strong
ties of relationship connecting the planters with the
mother country. There is not the slightest doubt but
that the check which the consumption of China teas
appears to have sustained in England is entirely due to
these causes. But already there is a growing and positive
revulsion of taste in many sections of that country
in favor of the purer China teas, owing to their truer
character, greater delicacy and richness of flavor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief and only advantages that India and Ceylon
teas possess over those of China and Japan are their great
strength and thickness in the cup, which are due mainly
to the modern methods of fermentation and firing by
steam and machinery. China and Japan teas excel them
in flavor and aroma, occupying in regard to them a
position analogous to that of French wines, in comparison
with those of other countries. The product of
the latter may be stronger and heavier in body, but for
richness of flavor and delicacy of aroma—essential qualities
in both wine and tea—the French grape and China
tea-leaf stand alone and unrivalled for their intrinsic
merits, as well as for their being the only true teas, in all
that constitutes tea. Broadly stated, the predominant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>features of India and Ceylon teas are <i>body</i> and <i>strength</i>,
those of China and Japan <i>flavor</i> and <i>aroma</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is also this difference between them, that while
a given quantity of India and Ceylon teas will yield a
larger amount of a darker-colored liquor and stronger in
flavor than that of a similar quantity of China and Japan,
they still lack the richness and delicacy of the latter, if
not indeed the properties of a true tea altogether.
Again, as to how much liquor an equal quantity of the
former will yield in comparison with a similar weight
of the latter, is another mooted question. As far as
quantity, color and body are concerned, it must be
admitted that India and Ceylon teas are once and a half
greater. But in flavor and aroma, the essential qualities
that constitute and are most appreciated in tea, China and
Japan teas far excel them. Thus if one pound of China
or Japan teas yields five gallons of extract of a certain
weight, strength and color, one pound of India or Ceylon
will produce seven and a half gallons of a similar beverage,
but will be devoid of that fragrant flavor and rich
aroma so characteristic of the China and Japan product.
The value of tea, intrinsically and commercially, depending
principally upon the character and flavor of the
infusion, as well as the aroma imparted to it by the
volatile oil.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ceylon, like India teas, will not keep as long or as well
as either China or Japan, becoming sour and rancid by
exposure in a few months, defects attributed to the
method of curing, but in reality inherent in them. Again
the latter contain a larger percentage of the active principle
(<i>theine</i>) and less of the astringent property (<i>tannin</i>),
and are consequently less injurious and more refreshing.
The great excess of the latter property in both India and
Ceylon teas accounting for their dark color, and harsh<a id='tn121'></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>pungent taste in the infusion, as well as being the unsuspected
cause of the indigestion and nervousness among
those who use them to any extent. So that in view of
the strenuous efforts now made to introduce India and
Ceylon teas into the American market, it may be well to
here caution consumers against their injurious and deleterious
effects on the human system, such injury being
caused, not alone by the excess of tannin, but also by
the sap or juice of the natural leaf not being sufficiently
expressed before the leaves are fired by proper fermentation.
It being claimed by physicians and others that
to the fixed and general use of these teas in England
is attributable the great increase of heart-burn, flatulency,
nervousness and dyspepsia among the people of that
country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Against the dubious and questionable advantages of
body and strength so loudly vaunted in India and Ceylon
teas, China and Japan possess others—greater and more
important ones—among which are that the tea-grower in
the latter countries working his own land in smaller
quantities brings greater care and more industry to the
task. Again in the methods of curing and firing the leaf,
the latter have also the advantage of superiority, as it is
now generally admitted by experts and others interested
in the business that though the “Sirocco” or hot-air
process may be more rapid in its work and certain not
to taint the leaves in any way, it is yet open to doubt
whether the older, slower, and more natural method of
firing in pans over charcoal fires is not the better, more
thorough and effective in its results than the new and
artificial one. The Chinese and Japanese have been curing
and firing teas by that method for centuries, and they
surely ought to be the best judges by this time.
To sum up, India and Ceylon may produce <i>stronger</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and more <i>powerful</i> teas if that can be called a recommendation,
but for <i>smoothness of liquor, richness and delicacy
of flavor</i>, such as are essential to every-day, universal
consumption, the China tea-leaf and French grape stand
and will continue to stand unrivalled. India and Ceylon
may claim to be the teas of to-day, but it remains to be
seen whether that day be long or short, as in my humble
opinion, without laying any claim to the prophetic, the
teas of the future as in the past will be China and Japan
teas.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>JAVA TEAS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Tea culture was introduced to the Island of Java in
1826, the seeds and plants being obtained from Japan for
the purpose. The plants having thrived beyond expectation,
a plantation of 800 trees was formed the following
year in the residency of <a id='tn123'></a>Buitenzorg, although samples of
tea grown elsewhere on the island were shown at an
exhibition held in Amsterdam in 1828. Another plantation
was subsequently established in the district of Carvet
in Preanger, from which its cultivation later extended to
Krawang and other residencies in the island. So successful
was the progress made that in 1833 the number of
trees in the latter residency was returned at more than
500,000. Up to 1842 tea was cultivated in Java exclusively
for Government account and under the immediate
supervision of its own officials, nearly 14,000,000 trees
being in bearing there that year. But the number of
laborers required for its cultivation and manipulation
becoming so large, the supervision so difficult, and the
results so unsatisfactory, the Government was eventually
compelled to relinquish many of its plantations to private
parties, contracting at the same time to purchase their
product at a fixed price. This change proved beneficial,
resulting in a still further extension and improvement in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>its culture; the contracts with the Government being
entirely annulled after seven years’ trial, and the industry
being left to private energy and capital, without control
or interference, it soon developed to large proportions.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Java the best teas are grown at an elevation ranging
from 3,000 to 4,000 feet above sea-level, the finest
being produced on the mountain slopes, in the residencies
of Preanger, Bagelen and Banjœmas. Nothing could be
more attractive than the plantations situated on these
ranges, each containing from 70,000 to 100,000 plants in
perennial bloom and giving employment to from twenty-five
to thirty families of native laborers. The methods
of cultivation and preparation are much the same as in
Japan, though latterly the India system is being largely
adopted, both Black and Green teas being prepared at
will from the leaf of the same plants. The seeds are
first sown in nurseries, from which the young plants,
when old enough, are set out in line, at a uniform distance
of four feet from each other. The trees are never
allowed to exceed two and a half feet in height, and are
much more prolific than either the China or India species,
the leaves being picked from them all the year round.
They are known to commerce under the appellations of
“Preangers,” “Krawangs,” “Cheribons,” “Bagelens”
and “Banjœmas” teas, and usually converted into Pekoe,
Souchong, Pekoe-Souchong, Congous, Oolongs and Imperials,
Broken-leaf and Siftings after the India and Ceylon
manner. The leaves for the different “makes” are
sorted during picking and graded according to size, the
smallest and tenderest being converted into Pekoe, the
medium size into Souchongs, and the largest and oldest
into Congous, Oolongs, Imperials and Broken-leaf teas.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Java Pekoe</span></b>—Is a small, jet-black leaf, lightly tipped
with yellowish ends. The liquor is extremely dark,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>almost black in color, heavy and thick in body, bitter
and astringent in flavor, and entirely unsuited to the
average taste.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Java Souchongs</span></b>—Are composed of the older and
coarser leaves of the tea-plant. They are bold in style,
black in color, dark in draw, thick in body, and exceedingly
strong in flavor, too much so to use alone.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Pekoe-Souchongs</span></b>—Comprise the older and coarser
leaves of the respective pickings, considered too large
for conversion into Pekoe and too small for Souchong,
possessing the same characteristics in draw and drink
of both the latter varieties.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Java Congous</span></b>—Are large, rough, loosely made teas,
dark in liquor, heavy in body, and strong to rankness in
flavor, on the whole a most undesirable sort for any
purpose, becoming rancid and sour when kept too long.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Java Oolongs</span></b>—Are Java tea pure and simple, made
in imitation of China Oolongs, but possessing nothing

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Java Green Teas</span></b>—Include Imperial Hysons and
Young Hysons, but are only so in name, as they still
possess all the peculiarities of Java tea in draw and
drinking qualities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Java teas in general are particularly small in leaf, dull-black
in color, but exceedingly well made and handsome
in appearance, almost perfect in style, approximating
more to Indias in make, color and character, but do not
keep well, becoming rank and sour on brief exposure to the
atmosphere. The liquor of all of them is also deficient
in strength and flavor, being devoid of any pronounced
fragrance or distinctive aroma, defects attributable in a
great measure to faulty and imperfect manufacture, as
well as to the fact that they are picked from the plants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the year round and allowed no resting or recuperating
period. The annual product averages about 15,000,000
pounds, packed in large wooden cases weighing from
100 to 120 pounds, and shipped principally to Holland,
Germany and England, only small lots occasionally being
received in this country.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the present time the cultivation of tea is mainly confined
to the province of Preanger, in the western part of
the island, the industry being in the hands of experienced
planters, who spare no pains to increase the product and
quality of the article. Notwithstanding their care, however,
they cannot congratulate themselves on the profits
resulting therefrom, the price continuing to fall, the
planters being forced to expend their utmost energies to
save their plantations from ruin, this being not only
the case with recent enterprises, but also with the older
plantations that have been flourishing for many years.
In addition to decline in price, the Java tea plantations
have been ravaged by an insect known as the <i>Theluis</i> (tea
louse), which each year destroys in value hundreds of
thousands of florins, but at the same time there is noticeable
a distinct improvement in the quality of the tea produced
there. Until very recently they were only used in
Europe when mixed with China teas on account of the
excessive quantity of tannin which they contain, and
known tendency to rapid decay, the improvement in
quality now rendering that process needless, the introduction
of Assam plants enabling the planters to compete
with India and Ceylon.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>OTHER VARIETIES OF TEA.</h3>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>African Teas<a id='tn126'></a></span></b>—It is expected that both India and
Ceylon will doubtless have in the near future a formidable
rival to their tea industry in South Africa, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>promising tea gardens have been extensively laid out by
planters from India, with seeds and plants obtained from
Ceylon. The soil and climate of the region around
Natal particularly are very similar to those of Southern
India, and especially favorable to the successful and
profitable production of the tea plant. Recent reports
pronounce the venture a complete success, the product in
1892 amounting to over 20,000 pounds of tea, although
introduced only three years prior and grading in quality
with the average teas of Ceylon and India. It is predicted
that in a few years South Africa will not only
rival but excel the latter countries not only in the quantity
but also in the quality of their product.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Singapore Tea<a id='tn127a'></a></span></b>—Tea plantations have been recently
formed in the districts of Johore and Seragoon, from
seeds and plants imported from India, but as yet are
only in an experimental stage. Samples already received
are large in leaf, coarse in make, coal black in color, an
effort being made to imitate Oolongs in style. The infusion
is dark red, heavy, strong and somewhat astringent
in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Perak Tea<a id='tn127b'></a></span></b>—Recently an invoice consisting of some
eighty half chests of tea grown in the Straits settlements
was shipped to London. The general quality was so
favorably commented on by the brokers and dealers
there that it found a ready sale at full prices for its
kind.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Fiji Tea</span></b>—Is another new addition to the constantly
increasing teas of commerce. It is produced from plants
imported from India and assorted into Pekoes, Congous
and Souchongs, grading with and approximating to Java
teas in style, color and character.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Caravan Tea</span></b>—Is simply a fine Lapsing or Padrae
Souchong, put up in Hankow for the Russian market, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>transported overland by caravan through Bokhara and
Central Asia to Moscow and Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Russian Tea</span></b>—Grown in the district of Transcaucasia,
consists largely of the leaves of a shrub possessing
the botanical name of <i>Vacinium staphylos</i>, which when
infused yields a decoction having some resemblance to
the ordinary teas of commerce, but is acrid and nauseating
in flavor. They are generally prepared for the express
purpose of mixing with inferior China tea, and also
with exhausted leaves, that is, tea once used, dried and
rolled again.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>American Tea<a id='tn128a'></a></span></b>—Samples of tea grown in South
Carolina have lately been received in the New York
market and tested there by experts, who pronounce
them only fair in quality, and ranking them with the
India, Ceylon and teas of that character.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Hop Tea</span></b>—Is a species of tea now being prepared
from common hops in the Kent district in England,
prepared and cured by the “Sirocco” process, after the
manner of India tea, and used chiefly to blend with the
ordinary teas of commerce, the combination resembling
a mixture of Virginia smoking tobacco and a rough-leaved
Assam tea. It is claimed to be healthy and wholesome,
from the fact that the <i>lapulin</i> of the hops counteracts or
neutralizes the excess of <i>tannin</i> contained in the India
teas, but nearly doubles it in price.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>PARAGUAYAN TEA.</h4>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Yerba <a id='tn128b'></a>Maté</span></b>, or “Paraguayan tea,” which although
not entering into general use or commerce, is yet deserving
of notice in this work from its extensive consumption
among the inhabitants of South America. It is
prepared from the leaves and stems of the <i>Ilex</i>, a species
of holly found growing in a wild state in that country.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>In size and appearance it closely resembles an orange
tree, having a whitish bark and leafy, tufted boughs,
with leaves four inches long when full grown, dark-green
in color, thick, glossy and crenate at the edges, pale on
the lower surface and containing the same active principle,
<i>Theine</i>, so characteristic of China tea. The flowers
or blossoms are small and white, hanging in clusters at
the angles of the leaves, the fruit or berries being red,
smooth and similar to those of the common holly. So
closely does it approach the tea of China in effect, that
many authorities claim it to be a species of that plant,
yielding a liquor similar in many respects. But while
not containing as much volatile oil as the latter, owing
to the primitive manner in which it is prepared, it
nevertheless yields a most agreeable and refreshing beverage,
enjoyed by many and forming the staple drink of
millions of the inhabitants of Paraguay and other South
American countries.</p>

<p class='c009'>Expeditions to collect and prepare it start annually
from the capital to the <i>Yerbales</i> or groves in the interior,
taking extra mules and bullocks to bring the dried leaves
back. On reaching the forests <i>Tatacuas</i> or camps are
formed by clearing the ground and beating it down with
heavy mallets until it is sufficiently hard and level for the
purpose. The leaf in the natural state is from four to
five inches long, thick, leathery, glossy and serrated at
the edges, and is prepared for use in a network made
from raw-hide straps stretched on posts, underneath
which wood fires are kindled. The leaves and stems, as
they are collected, are placed on these nets and scorched,
care being taken only that they do not ignite or burn
too much—in which state they closely resemble senna.
When sufficiently scorched they are ground, in some
instances, into a coarse powder in a rude wooden mill,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>weighed and packed for export in large bullock hides,
holding from 200 to 250 pounds each and left to dry
and tighten in the sun for a few days, becoming meanwhile
as hard and impervious as stone. This method of
curing is very defective, as the stems and other extraneous
matter imparts a “woody” flavor to the infusion
which is otherwise very agreeable and refreshing. It is
prepared for use in a kind of filter or perforated bowl
called <i>Maté</i>, from which it derives its trade name. The
infusion is yellowish in color, almost syrupy in body,
possessing an “herby” or weedy flavor, bitterish in taste,
much disliked at first by those unaccustomed to its use,
but nevertheless pleasant, wholesome and refreshing,
pleasanter still when cold, and while approaching in its
chemical composition to the regular teas of commerce it
does not cause the wakefulness or nervousness attributed
to the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the smaller towns and rural districts of South America
it is regarded as a regular form of diet, and not, like
ordinary tea, a mere accompaniment to the meal, being
looked upon as a necessary, as well as a luxury, by the
inhabitants, and is the first thing offered a visitor when
entering a house, the table being rarely without it. The
<i>gaucho</i> of the plains will travel for weeks asking no
better fare than a little dried beef, washed down with
copious drafts of <i>Maté</i>, the Indian carriers subsisting
for days together on it alone, in short, being to them
what the tea of China is to its inhabitants, essential and
indispensable. The Government has a monopoly of its
sale, a heavy duty being imposed on its exportation,
forming the principal source of its revenue. The popular
method of preparing it in Paraguay is to mix large
proportions of raw sugar with a decoction made from the
powder or leaves until a thick syrup is produced, when it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>ready for drinking, the nourishing properties attributed to
the infusion by the natives, it is contended, being due, in
a great measure, to the excess of saccharine matter. It
ranges in price from four to eight cents per pound in the
prepared state, one pound yielding as much as twenty
quarts of the infusion of moderate strength. It is difficult
to get at any reliable returns for the entire traffic in
this commodity, the production being carried on in such
a crude and desultory manner, extending, as it does, over
a vast area of wild country, the official returns furnishing
only an approximate estimate of its trade and consumption.
The total production may, however, be computed at
1,500,000 arobas, equivalent to about 40,000,000 pounds
per annum, the total consumption averaging thirteen
pounds <i>per capita</i> to the population, as against two
pounds of coffee and one-fourth pound of China tea. Its
use is confined chiefly to Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentine,
Peru, Chili and Brazil. Its consumption in Paraguay and
Argentine alone is over 35,000,000 pounds per annum, as
against 5,000,000 pounds of coffee. Surprising as this large
quantity may appear at first sight, it is explained by the
fact that <i>Maté</i> constitutes the only vegetable nourishment
of many classes in these communities, forming, as it does,
the chief dietic beverage of over 20,000,000 of people in
South America alone. Yet it is singular, to say the
least, that its consumption should be so great in such
large coffee-producing countries, and which export
annually over half the world’s supply of that commodity.
Strong efforts are being made at the present time to open up
a trade in it in Europe, particularly in France, where the
cafés now advertise it among their regular beverages,
and shops devoted to its exclusive sale also recommend
it. But whether these efforts will succeed remains
to be proven, considering the enormous increase in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>production of so many other teas and their established
consumption.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>TRADE GRADINGS OF TEA.</h4>

<p class='c015'>A Standard Invoice of Green tea contains a number
of “Lines,” made up as follows: Gunpowder, No. 1
and 2 and 3; Imperial, No. 1, 2 and 3; Young Hyson,
No. 1, 2 and 3. There being rarely more than two lines
of Hyson, and never more than one of <a id='tn132'></a>Twankay.</p>

<p class='c009'>A “Chop” of Oolongs comprises four, sometimes five,
“Lines” termed “Firsts,” “Seconds,” “Thirds,”
“Fourths” and “Fifths,” when any, which are again
subdivided into “Brackets” or “Numbers,” ranging
from one to ten but similar in grade.</p>

<p class='c009'>An Invoice of “English Breakfast teas” includes a
quantity of Capers, Pekoes, Congou and Souchong teas,
graded and classed according to the district of production,
by which terms they are best known to trade.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Standard Invoice of Japans embrace some Pan-fired,
Sun-dried and Basket-fired teas with occasionally other
makes, also ranking according to the different districts.</p>

<p class='c009'>A “Break” or “chop” of India or Ceylon include
Pekoes, Congous, Pekoe-Souchongs, Broken-leaf and
Fannings, and are best known to trade by their plantation
names and district appellations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The term “Muster” means Sample-package or chest,
the name on top of label the vessel, route or “chop,” the

</div>
<hr class='c007'>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_4 c008'>The Teas of commerce are subject to four principal
descriptions of sophistication—“Facing” or Coloring
with deleterious compounds, in order to
enhance their appearance;—Substituting with spent, partially-used
or exhausted leaves to increase their bulk and
reduce the cost;—Mixing or blending with spurious or foreign
leaves, and—Sanding or adulterating with a variety
of mineral matter, chiefly iron or steel filings, to add to
the weight. Each trade has its own special form of adulteration,
and as in the milk business the most prevalent
sophistications are watering and skimming, so in the Tea-trade
the besetting malpractice is coloring and mixing
with or substitution of partially-exhausted tea leaves, so
that the main efforts of experts and tea-analysts should be
directed more to this form of adulteration. The other
forms have received some attention from chemists and
others interested in the article, but not to the extent which
the importance of the subject merits. But it is against the
two former most common and dangerous forms of adulteration
that the principal efforts of tea-analysts and inspectors
should more particularly be directed; and, while
considerable of this nefarious and positively injurious
work is done in the countries of importation, by far the
greater portion is perpetrated in the countries of production.
For consummate skill in the “tricks of trade,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the Chinese as a people have long been proverbial.
“They are a self-ended people,” says an old writer, “having
the same reputation in Asia that the Jews have in
Europe.” Yet there are strong reasons for stating that
many dealers in our own and other tea-drinking countries
have become expert imitators of their methods,
especially in the minor forms of coloring, mixing, repacking
and refacing. The sophistications in our own country
being chiefly confined to the admixture of damaged,
stained and tainted teas with sound, pure or high-grade
goods, with the object of concealing or disguising their
defects, and the substitution of one variety for another
by repacking and relabeling. The latter form being
practiced to a much greater extent than most people
imagine, giving rise to a special branch of business in
nearly all of the larger cities.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>“FACED” OR COLORED TEAS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Of the various forms of adulteration practiced in China
and Japan artificial coloring or “facing” is perhaps the
most prevalent and glaring. The material used for the
purpose is usually composed of Prussian blue, gypsum,
indigo, <a id='tn134'></a>turmeric, and more frequently, China clay, a whitish
iridescent powder, resembling mica, variously composed,
but generally consisting of <i>kaolin</i> (soapstone), and sulphate
of lime. While that in use in Japan is not known, its composition
being a secret, known only to the manufacturers,
but is evidently a preparation of gypsum and kaolin, the
Japanese contending that it is a vegetable compound pure
and simple. That kaolin is used in its preparation can
hardly be denied, as kaolin contains sulphur, and many
of the lower grades of Japan teas are found on infusion to
possess a slightly sulphurous odor. It has been proved,
however, whatever its nature, to be less harmful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>injurious than the Chinese compound, and used only in
the manipulation and sophistication of the lower or commoner
grades of tea in that country.</p>

<p class='c009'>The process of coloring or facing Green teas is performed
by placing a portion of Prussian blue in a
porcelain bowl, not unlike a chemist’s mortar, and pulverizing
it into a fine powder, a small quantity of
gypsum being meanwhile burned over a charcoal fire, to
soften it, after which it is ground fine. The two substances
are next mixed together, in the proportions of
one part blue to four parts gypsum, both making in
combination a light-blue preparation, in which state
it is applied to the leaves during the last process of
firing, about five minutes prior to removal from the pans,
the time being regulated by a burning joss stick. The
Saihoo taking a handful of the compound, scatters it
over the leaves while in the pans, other operators tossing
and turning the leaves around rapidly with their hands
meantime in order that it may equally diffuse among
them. One ounce of coloring-matter will face fifteen
pounds of leaves, imparting to them a dull leaden-blue
hue, and “glossy” or greasy appearance, readily detected
in the hand. In many districts, most notably in Ningpo
and Canton, <a id='tn135a'></a>turmeric, kaolin, and China clay are more
extensively employed for the purpose. This almost transparent
form of adulteration is readily detected in the
following manner:—</p>

<p class='c009'>(1) When the tea is heavily coated it may be easily
recognized by its dull leaden-blue color and greasy
appearance in the hand, or by placing a small quantity
of the leaves on a piece of glass or smooth table, on
removing them the coloring-matter will be found adhering
to the hands, glass or table, and its nature, whether Prussian
blue, <a id='tn135b'></a>turmeric, kaolin or indigo, readily determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>with the aid of a microscope. (2) When only lightly
colored or suspected, place a sample of the leaves in a
cup or wine-glass and pour on briskly boiling water
and stir well for two or three minutes, then strain well
through a thin muslin cloth. The coloring-matter, if
any, will be found adhering to the cloth, that passing
through, sticking to the sides, or forming a sediment at
the bottom of the vessel into which it is strained. If
these deposits be treated with a preparation of chlorine,
or a solution of chloride of lime, and turn white, the
coloring substance used is indigo. But if treated
with a little potash, and it becomes brown, it will
prove to be Prussian blue, the application of a little
sulphuric acid having the effect of turning it blue
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>What are known to trade as “Canton Green teas” are
made from tea-dust and exhausted leaves ground up fine
and aglutinized with a preparation of gum, glue or other
starchy substance to unite and hold them together and
then artificially colored or glazed. This fabrication is
readily detected by crushing the so-called leaves between
the fingers or rubbing them between the hands, upon which
they leave a yellowish-brown stain, greasy in nature.
Or by powdering a small quantity of the alleged leaves
and treating the dust with a dilution of sulphuric acid it
becomes very much discolored, and if it assumes a
leaden-blue color on the application of caustic potash it
is colored with Prussian blue. Again, place a small
quantity of the leaves in a cup or glass and pour on
boiling water, they will immediately begin to disintegrate
and form a thick, gluey deposit at the bottom of the
vessel. By treating this precipitate with a little iodine
the mass will become separated and dissolve into its
original dust.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>FOREIGN OR SPURIOUS LEAVES IN TEA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Another reprehensible form of adulteration is the substitution
or admixture of foreign or spurious leaves obtained
from other plants, which resemble in structure but
differ widely in character from the true tea-leaf, such as
those of the willow, plum or ash. Millions of pounds of
these leaves are annually picked, cured and colored in the
same manner as tea in China, and used for the purpose of
increasing the bulk and reducing the cost, while in England,
particularly, the leaves of the birch, elm, willow,
chestnut, poplar and hawthorne have been extensively
used for the same purpose. The coloring material used
in the latter country differs from that used in China and
Japan being still more dangerous and injurious to health.
This form of adulteration, however, is trivial when compared
with the former one, but, nevertheless, the expert
and analyst are frequently called upon to deal with it to
a much greater extent than most people imagine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such foreign leaves in tea may be best detected by
their botanical character or by the absence of the special
structural marks which distinguish the genuine tea-leaf
from that of all other leaves in the vegetable kingdom,
for while the true leaf bears a strong resemblance to that
of the willow, ash and plum, it varies, however, in size
form and structure. The border of the true tea-leaf is
more regularly serrated, the serration stopping just short
of the stalk, and the venations are very characteristic, the
veins running out from the mid-rib almost parallel to one
another, but altering their course before the border of the
leaf is reached, and turning so as to leave a bare space
just within the border of the leaf. So that in making an
examination of a sample of tea for the purpose of ascertaining
whether these distinctive characteristics are
present in the leaves under treatment, it will be found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>convenient to pour hot water on them so as to soften,
uncurl and spread them out more easily, as otherwise
considerable difficulty will be experienced owing to the
brittleness of the tea-leaves in the dry state.</p>

<p>SKELETON OF GENUINE TEA-LEAF.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But in order to better detect the presence of spurious
leaves in tea a keener knowledge of the botanical formation
of the true tea-leaf is requisite, for which purpose the use
of a microscope will be found an invaluable aid. Tea-leaves
in general construction bear a strong resemblance
to those of the willow and many other plants of the
kind, vary widely in size and form, being much smaller,
more deeply serrated, and ending more regularly just
short of the stalk. The venations are very characteristic,
the veins running out from the middle rib, almost parallel
with each other, altering their course before reaching the
extremities, and turning so as to leave a bare space within
the border. When infused and unfolded it is of a bright-green
color, the loopings together of the principal veinings
in the true leaf being very characteristic. While the
spurious leaf is either of a greenish-yellow or reddish-brown
color, and irregular in form under the same conditions
or when deprived of its cosmetics.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>To still better distinguish between them treat a sample
of the suspected tea as in making an ordinary infusion to
soften and expand the leaves, then separate and uncurl them
and lay flat on a piece of glass or other smooth surface
for comparison with the genuine leaf. Next see that they
agree in description and formation, but more especially in
the venations and serrations. Or soak the leaves in hot
water, and carefully unroll and closely examine their formation
and structure and then compare closely. The
epidermis of the lower surface of the true leaf can be
with a little caution detached in small portions with a
sharp razor, and then analyze the frame or skeleton of
the leaf in a little water or glycerine, under a microscope,
comparing the venations and serrations with those of the
genuine tea-leaf. Still another simple and inexpensive
test is to boil a few of the suspected leaves for a minute
or two on a watch glass, with a little distilled water, and
add an equal portion of burnt magnesia, treating the
whole until it is reduced to a large-sized drop. If no
crystalline sublimate is obtained therefrom by the operation
the leaves cannot be those of genuine tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chemically an examination of the ash of tea-leaves
also affords some criteria which may also be utilized for
the purpose of identifying the true tea-leaf. For instance,
in common kinds of wood, such as oak, deal and pine,
the proportion of ash is a few-tenths per cent. of the
whole, and by taking wood in its ordinary air-dried condition
it contains some 20 to 30 per cent. of moisture.
Leaves, on the other hand, contain 10, 20 and even 30
times as much mineral matter, there being doubtless a
connection between this abundance of mineral matter
and the active chemical changes which take place in the
leaves during the growth of the plant. In tea-leaves,
therefore, as in leaves in general, the ash amounts to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>considerable percentage, usually averaging about 6 per
cent., so that a chemical examination of the ash forms an
important part of the analysis of tea. The proportion
of ash in all teas is tolerably constant, genuine tea rarely
yielding so little as 5 and never exceeding 6 per cent. of
ash on incineration. Therefore, to determine the amount
of ash, weigh a small quantity of the tea in its ordinary
commercial state and burn it in a platinum crucible and
then re-weigh the resultant ash; by observing a few
simple precautions very constant and accurate results are
attainable by this method. The crucible should be clean
and bright, the lid fitting precisely; an iron triangle,
covered with a tobacco pipe may be employed to support
the crucible during ignition. The operation is then
commenced by igniting the empty crucible, and allowing
it to cool, being placed for that purpose on a piece of
porcelain or iron, immediately weighing the crucible on
becoming cold. Next place one or two grams of tea in
the crucible, weighing both together, and ignite over a
spirit lamp or good gas-burner, stirring the contents with
a platinum wire for a few minutes. When ignition is
complete the crucible is covered with the lid, let cool
again and immediately weighed a second time. If there is
any doubt as to the completeness of the ignition, the crucible
must be again ignited, and if there is no difference in
weight, the ignition is thereby proved finished. As is
obvious, in order to obtain accurate results it is
indispensable that the crucible should be in the
same condition when it is weighed empty and when
weighed with the ash, and this is insured by the
preliminary ignition and rapid re-weighing, as above
described.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>This analysis is especially important, inasmuch as the
tea which furnished the ash was of guaranteed purity, so
that no question of the possibility of its sophistication
could arise. On examining this analysis it will be
observed that tea-ash contains a quantity of iron, also
some manganese, the presence of manganese being so
marked in tea-ash that on subsequent treatment of the
ash with water a deep-green solution of manganate is
obtained. Owing to this presence of manganese in tea-ash
it also invariably evolves chlorine very perceptibly
when it is treated with hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the analysis of the tea-ash is referred to it will be
noted that more than one-half of it should be soluble in

a determination is made by boiling the ash several times
with a little water, filtering and washing the residue in
the filter, drying the precipitate, igniting and weighing it.
The weight of the insoluble part of the ash may then be
subtracted from the weight of the entire ash, in which
manner both the percentage of the soluble and insoluble
ash will be conveniently arrived at, in which case the following
determination of the percentage of “soluble” and
“insoluble ash” in 100 parts of spurious leaves and pure

<p class='c009'>Proving that in spurious leaves the ratio of soluble or
insoluble ash is very different from what it is in genuine
tea-leaves, and that an ash of such composition cannot
be very soluble in water.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Peligot has also pointed out that tea leaves differ from
other leaves by their extraordinary richness in nitrogen,
the prepared leaf being by the process of curing rendered
still more nitrogenous than the raw or spent leaves,
the former averaging, according to his experiments, 6
per cent. of nitrogenous matter, and the latter 4.37, so
that if the tea-leaf be unique in containing such a high
percentage of nitrogen, it is obvious that a determination
of nitrogen in tea may also be useful as a method of
identification.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tea-extract also yields a comparatively large quantity
of ammonia when it is boiled with potash or permanganate
of potash, and it is probable that this characteristic
may also prove very valuable in the testing of tea.
A solution containing about 10 per cent. of solid potash,
free from ammonia and nitrogenous matter is required
for the purpose, and easily obtained. So that a deficiency
of theine, a deficiency of nitrogen, and a deficiency of
ammonia are all indicative of the presence of foreign
leaves in tea.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SPENT OR <a id='tn145'></a>EXHAUSTED LEAVES IN TEA</h3>

<p class='c015'>Are principally used in the adulteration of Black teas,
and is effected by adding or substituting leaves that have
been at least once used, and from which all the vital
properties have been extracted. The Chinese being
inveterate tea-drinkers, large quantities of these leaves
are always to be had for the purpose, they are re-dried
and subjected to a treatment of gypsum or terra-japonica,
in order to make them retain their curl, and then glazed
or “faced” with a preparation composed of either
graphite or silica to enhance their appearance in the
hand; a decoction obtained from catechu or logwood
being next added to impart a tea-like color to the liquor
when infused. This vile compound is known to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Chinese as “Bastard tea,” and is rarely sold alone, being
used principally for mixing or blending with pure
teas.</p>

<p class='c009'>The presence of spent or exhausted leaves in either
Green or Black tea is best determined by estimating the
amount of tannin contained in the liquor after infusion,
and for which experiment various tests are in use. A
large proportion of the tea-extract is found to consist of
tannin (tannic acid), there being much more in Green
than in Black tea, the larger portion of that originally
existing in the latter being dissipated by the extra fermentation
to which this variety is subjected in curing
and firing. Green teas contain on an average about 15
per cent. of tannin, Black teas never exceeding 10 per
cent. This rate, however, varies considerably from different
causes, such as age, quality, soil and climatic condition
of the districts of growth, the main average being
12 and 9 per cent. respectively in pure teas. Spent or
exhausted leaves, on the other hand, contain only 2 per
cent. on an average at the highest estimate, a difference
of 7 to 10 per cent. of tannin, as will be observed, in
favor of pure teas.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the purpose of estimating the percentage of
tannin contained in tea, the simplest method is to make
an infusion of the leaves and pour it into a cup or glass
and add to it a small quantity of a standard solution of
plumbic acetate. The acetate will cause the tannin to
form a precipitate, which must be removed and weighed
in a small scale fitted for the purpose; then by taking
the nominal percentage of tannin contained in pure teas
at 12 in Green and 10 in Black and 2 per cent. in Spent
or exhausted leaves, the difference will be the percentage
of adulteration, the extent being indicated by the lessened
proportion of tannin in the same ratio. The presence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Catechu (soluble salts of iron) is best ascertained by
making an ordinary infusion of the leaves, allowing the
liquor to cool and pouring it into a cup or glass. Next
add a preparation of neutral plumbic acid and separate
the precipitate formed by the introduction of the chemical
by filtration, and adding a little argentic nitrate to the filtrate.
If catechu be present the residue will turn a dark-brown,
the liquid meanwhile acquiring a deep yellow hue,
while under the same conditions the liquor of pure tea will
remain unaffected. But if the cosmetic be extensively
employed, a weak solution of ferric-chloride will cause
the precipitate to turn light-green or it may be detected
under the microscope if heavily coated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Spent and spurious leaves may also be readily detected
by the “ash test,” through the following deductions: Pure
teas, as shown above, contain from 5 to 6 per cent. of ash
on incineration, 2 per cent. of this being soluble in boiling
water; any increase of these parts is a certain indication
of the presence of foreign or exhausted leaves in
the sample treated. The percentage of ash contained in
spent leaves, ranging from 10 to 30, and in spurious leaves
from 40 to 50, in many instances, while the residue of teas
adulterated with mineral matter have been known to reach
as high as 75 to 80 per cent. of the incinerated sample.
The presence of logwood is best exposed by the addition
of a few drops of sulphuric acid to an infusion
made with the leaves in the ordinary way. If any of
the dye be present this acid will cause the liquid to turn
a deep red, but if the tea be uncolored the liquor will
remain entirely unaffected. Graphite being visible to the
naked eye is easily distinguished by its characteristic
glossy nature, or can be separated by treating the leaves
with boiling water in the usual manner and evaporating
the infusion. The substance, if present, will form a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>deposit at the bottom of the vessel or will be found
adhering to its sides if used in large quantities. While
Silica is readily recognized by the increased amount of
ash insoluble in the water obtained by calcimining a
sample of the tea so adulterated, as above described.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SAND AND MINERAL MATTER IN TEAS</h3>

<p class='c015'>Is frequently introduced into tea with the object of adding
weight, and is best detected by the “ash-test.” As formerly
stated, the leaves of genuine tea, or tea of fair commercial
value, yield from 5 to 6 per cent. of ash or mineral
matter on incineration, 2 per cent. of which is again soluble
in water. This rate is fairly constant, and ranges from
5 in Black teas to 6 per cent. in pure Green, rarely yielding
as low as 5 in the former and never exceeding 6 in the
latter, while many of the teas of commerce are found to
yield from 13 to 20 per cent. of ash on incineration.
Such teas are unmistakably sophisticated, and will be
found, on analysis, to contain sand or other mineral
matter in their composition.</p>

<p class='c009'>To determine the amount of mineral matter contained
in teas so adulterated, proceed as in the case of spurious
and spent leaves, which analysis may be again confirmed by
a determination of the ratio of soluble to insoluble matter
contained in the ash. The result is obtained by boiling
the ash in a little water and filtering the precipitate,
drying, burning, weighing and subtracting the residue or
insoluble matter from the original weight of the ash. By
this process both the soluble and insoluble parts are
ascertained, and if the sample be pure, but 3 to 3½ per
cent. of insoluble will remain, any increase of these
figures clearly denoting adulteration to that extent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where the burning of the leaves is inconvenient, the
following operation may be substituted: Weigh a sample
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>of the suspected tea and boil with about ten times its
weight of water in a porcelain dish or beaker. This boiling
will wash the sand off the leaves and sink to the
bottom, the leaves floating in the liquid. When the
liquid has cooled sufficiently, the leaves may be removed
with the hand, the liquid and sand being poured into a
filter. The sand is then washed, dried and ignited in a
platinum plate and weighed, in which manner the amount
of sand yielded by 50 or 100 grams of tea may be
actually weighed and ascertained. On examining the
analysis it will be found that tea-ash contains a quantity
of iron and some manganese, the presence of the latter
being so marked in tea-ash, that on subsequent treatment
of the ash with water a deep green solution of the manganate
is obtained. Owing to the presence of this
chemical, tea-ash also evolves chlorine very perceptibly,
particularly when treated with hydrochloric acid. If
the sample of tea treated yield <i>only</i> the normal percentage
of ash at the same time contains a considerable quantity
of silica, such a combination would afford the strongest
evidence of adulteration. This will be apparent from
the fact that tea-ash is an essential part of the tea, and if
a part of the tea-ash be absent, the sample must have
been deprived of at least the corresponding quantity of tea.
Spent leaves contain less ash than genuine tea, the average
being about 3.06 of ash in 100 parts of dried spent
leaves, and when the ash is deficient, the explanation is
that the genuine tea has been more or less replaced by
spent or exhausted leaves. But for all practical purposes
a complete analysis of tea-ash is not necessary, a determination
of the ratio of soluble to insoluble portions of
the ash answering the purpose as well. Such a determination
is made by boiling the ash several times with a
little water, filtering and washing the precipitate in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>filter, drying, igniting and weighing it. The weight of
the insoluble part of the ash may then be subtracted from
the original quantity, in which manner the percentage of
soluble and insoluble ash is obtained.</p>

<p class='c009'>Peligot has also pointed out that tea-leaves differ from
the leaves of other plants by their extraordinary richness
in nitrogen, the percentage averaging 4.37 per cent. in the
raw leaf of the former, and ranging from 5.10 to 6.60 per
cent. in the dried state. In the preparation of the fresh
leaves for market a quantity of juice is expressed from
them, the increase of nitrogen in the prepared leaf being
accounted for on the supposition that this juice is not as
rich in nitrogen as that still remaining in the leaf, and if
the prepared leaf be unique in containing this high percentage
of nitrogen, it is obvious that a determination of
nitrogen in tea may prove useful as a method of identification.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IRON AND STEEL FILINGS IN TEA</h3>

<p class='c015'>Are best detected by pulverizing a sample of the suspected
tea and spreading the powder on a piece of glass or plate,
and applying a magnet to the dust. If a quantity of the
particles gravitate and adhere to it, the tea is undoubtedly
adulterated in this form. While fabrications and sophistications
in general may be best exposed by treating an
infusion of the leaves with a watery solution of sulphuretted
hydrogen or a weak solution of ammonia. Under
the first treatment the liquor of pure teas will retain its
natural color, but will assume a light-blue tint under the
latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another simpler method for those who may not
have the chemicals or appliances convenient is to place
a small quantity of tea-leaves in a wine-glass or goblet,
pour on cold water, and stir or shake well for a few
minutes. The tea, if pure, will only slightly color the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>water, but if adulterated, a dark-colored liquor is quickly
yielded, which if boiled and let stand until cold will, if
spurious, become bitter and almost transparent as it cools,
while pure tea under the same conditions assumes a
darker color and pleasing flavor. The latter changes
arise from the tannin (a natural property in tea) of which
artificial tea is entirely devoid and adulterated teas in
proportion. Mineral adulterants, however, must be dealt
with by the ash-test, which is unerring, spurious leaves
by their botanical character and structural marks,
deficiency of tannin being invariably an indication of
spent or exhausted leaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The part of the tea which we really use being that
which passes into the infusion, in other words—the
Extract of tea—it is natural to look to this extract as
affording the directest evidence of the quality and
genuineness of a sample of tea. The extract may be
regarded both <a id='tn151'></a>quantitatively and qualitatively, and from the
former point of view we are led to the tea-assay or determination
of the weight of the tea-extract which a given
weight of tea is capable of yielding.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Peligot’s analyses we find the following determinations
of the tea-extract—the author being quite alive to
the importance of such a test:—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>These results being arrived at by the employment of a
valid but rather inconvenient method of weighing out ten
grams of tea-leaves and boiling them with water as long
as anything is dissolved out of them, and afterwards drying
up the exhausted leaves, first at a low temperature
and then at a higher one, finally weighing the exhausted
leaves. The loss in weight is the weight of the tea-extract,
care being taken to weigh the original tea and
the exhausted tea-leaves in the same state of dryness.
The results, as will be observed, are stated both in the
dried tea and in the tea in its ordinary commercial condition.
But, instead of weighing the tea-leaves before
and after extraction and taking the difference in weight
as the weight of the extract there is a more convenient
process—that of evaporating down the extract itself to
dryness and weighing <i>it</i>. The drying up of the exhausted
leaves and the getting them into the same hygroscopic
condition as the original tea presenting considerable practical
difficulties.</p>

<p class='c009'>The evaporation of the infusion to dryness and the
weighing of the dry extract is also a tedious process in
its unmodified state. But if a given quantity of tea be
boiled with successive portions of water no more tea-extract
is yielded than if the same tea be boiled once
with a large quantity of water, but whether the infusion
is kept for a length of time just at the boiling-point or
whether it be made to boil vigorously makes some difference
in the result, brisk-boiling extracting about one-tenth
more than slow boiling, so that if the boiling be
very vigorous half an hour’s boiling is just as effective as
an hour’s slow boiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Founded on these observations an assay of the tea-extract
may be made by the following simple process: Put
ten grams of tea into a pint flask and pour on about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>two-thirds of distilled water accurately measured, a cork
and bent tube is then adapted to the mouth of the flask
and a connection made with a condenser. The contents
of the flask are next heated and made to boil strongly.
That having been done the boiling is stopped and the
flask and condenser disconnected and the distillate
poured back into the flask and the decoction of tea
observed closely. If quite clear fifty grams are weighed
out and evaporated to dryness in a water-bath and
weighed till constant. If the decoction be not quite
clear by this time it is to be filtered hot; the first small
filtrate is best thrown away and the filtrate collected,
weighed, and dried in the water-bath until the residual
tea-extract becomes quite constant. Having performed
the operation in the manner directed, the weight of the
tea-extract actually weighed will be the weight of the
extract yielded by one gram of the sample to be assayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in coming to a decision as to the genuineness of
a sample of tea of which an analysis has been made by
this method, it is of importance to remember that genuine
tea is subject to considerable variation in composition.
The quality and condition of the leaf at the time of
gathering and the different treatments which it undergoes
in the process of manufacture, or whether the tea
is Black or Green, cause the composition to exhibit a
wide range of variation. Taking the percentage of the
extract as a basis from which to start, that in genuine tea
being from 32 up to 50 per cent. in its ordinary commercial
condition. Such being the case, it is obvious
that a determination of the percentage of extract will
not enable the expert or analyst to say whether the
sample of tea be of a lower or higher grade of pure tea,
or whether it is composed of a high grade of genuine tea
and a portion of exhausted leaves. In a general way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>however, this question is not of vital importance to the
analyst, as a solution may be arrived at from a determination
of the soluble ash, which would be found rather
deficient on incineration. For although tea may be
exceptionally rich in extract, and although there are
difficulties in the way of deciding whether a given
sample of tea consists of average quality or of fine tea
mixed with spent tea, there are no such difficulties in
recognizing the case of tea of average grade, mixed with
a considerable quantity of exhausted leaves, as it is
assumed in this formula that the soluble ash in genuine
tea is 3.6 per cent. and that in spent tea only 0.3 per
cent. But in using this formula it must be understood
that the results are only rough approximations, judgment
and discrimination being required to determine by it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea-extract yields a comparatively large quantity of
ammonia when it is boiled with potash and permanganate
of potash, and it is probable that this character may
prove very valuable also in testing the purity of tea, for
which purpose a solution containing about 10 per cent.
of solid potash, free from ammonia and nitrogenous
matter, is required and easily obtained. Ten grams of
this solution of potash is put into a small flask-retort,
working in an oil-bath and connected with a small condenser;
the whole apparatus to be carefully freed from
the last traces of ammonia, which is best accomplished
by distilling the water through it, after which from 5 to
10 parts of the tea infusion are poured into the retort,
which is then corked up and heated in an oil-bath to 150 C.
Having been maintained for a short time at this temperature
it is then lifted out of the bath and some pure water
poured into the retort, which is again to be heated in the
oil-bath. More than half of the water is then distilled
over and in this manner the “free ammonia” is obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>from the distillate. When this has been accomplished
some of the potash and permanganate solution is added
to the contents of the retort and distilled so as to yield
a distillate containing “albuminoid ammonia,” the result
being as follows in pure teas:—</p>

<p class='c009'>This experiment is made with the greatest ease, and
will also be found valuable by brokers and others interested
in tea for testing the strength of the tea-infusion.
As has already been observed, tea is also remarkably rich
in nitrogen, so much so that a determination of nitrogen
may be resorted to as a means of identification. With
this object it is best to take a sample of tea, first mixing
it up well and powder it in a mortar. Of this tea-powder
some 0.3 grams should be accurately weighed out. This
is then to be mixed with some 50 grams of oxide of
copper, which has been first oxidized without the employment
of nitric acid, and which shortly before using had
been ignited and allowed to cool. A combustion-tube of
hard German glass, closed at one end and perfectly clean,
is next charged as follows: At the closed end a layer,
some three to four inches in length, of a mixture of dry
bi-carbonate of soda and fused bi-chromate of potash is
placed, the mixture being intended to give out carbonic
acid. Next to this compound place two inches of oxide
of copper, then the mixture of tea and oxide of copper,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>then more oxide of copper and some clean metallic
copper on top, then a perforated cork and exit tube,
which dips under the mercury, and place the combustion-tube
in an appropriate furnace to heat. By heating the
layer of carbonate of soda and bi-chromate of potash,
carbonic acid is caused to traverse the tube and expel the
air from it. This having been done the tube is next
heated gradually from before so as to burn up the tea,
the gases being collected over the mercury. At the end
of the operation the carbonic acid is once more made to
traverse the tube by again heating the mixture at the
back, all the nitrogen being driven from the tube and
collected. Finally the carbonic acid is absorbed by
means of the potash and, the residual nitrogen gas is
measured with well-known precautions. This gas should
also be tested for bin-oxide of nitrogen by means of
oxygen and pyro-galate of potash, any bin-oxide of
nitrogen gas to be measured and allowed for in the test.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the most common forms of adulteration practiced
by dealers in this country is that of substituting
old and valueless Young Hysons for Japans or mixing
them together the better to disguise the fraud. The
mixing or blending of old, stale, weedy or smoky Congous
with Oolongs, particularly when such teas become
a drug on the market. The reduction of Moyunes by
the addition of Pingsueys in the proportions of half and
half and then refacing them as “True Moyunes.” The
refacing of Ningyongs and other Amoys as Formosas
being still another form, for which at the present low
prices of the commodity there is not the slightest occasion.
The most recent “trick” of the tea trade being that of
mixing Japan Nibs with Twankays and Hysons, the latter,
I regret to add, being now extensively adopted by at
one time reputable houses.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Some law should be passed in this country to ensure
the public against the possibility of purchasing spurious
and adulterated teas as in Russia, where the dealers are
compelled to sell their teas under government labels placed
on the packages by experts appointed by the Government
for that particular purpose and who work under official
inspectors, the expense of examining and labeling
being defrayed out of the revenue realized from the sale
of the labels to the dealers. To such an extent was the
nefarious practice carried on in that country that the
adoption of this system became imperative in order to
restore the confidence of the public in the genuineness
of the tea offered for sale, with the result of having
materially checked the traffic in spurious and adulterated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>teas in that country.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_4 c008'>There is no article handled by the grocer which
engages more of his time, demands greater
attention, or has a more important bearing upon
the success of his business than Tea. In many respects
it stands ahead of all other commodities in commanding
and maintaining patronage, also in that it is expected to
attract and retain trade for other articles, and at the same
time yield a larger margin of profit. As gain is the fundamental
object of business, and as Tea plays such an
essential part in determining this profit, we may be
excused if, considering the article from a purely practical
standpoint, we urge the relation which it bears to the
success of the dealer in it, and who, as a rule, experience
more difficulty in the selection of Tea than in any other
article he trades in. The cause is obvious, being due to
the numerous varieties and almost innumerable grades,
characters and flavors with which he is confronted, and to
be selected from, taken in connection with the diversity of
tastes and preferences to be catered to, it requiring no ordinary
skill or knowledge to make the proper selection under
these circumstances to suit patrons. The acquisition of
such knowledge, for all practical purposes, is not, however,
quite as difficult as many may suppose, as it can be fairly
obtained by a little study, a few simple and inexpensive
experiments and repeated trials to familiarize oneself with
the leading characteristics and values of the different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>varieties, grades and flavors of the teas best adapted to
each particular class or section of the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Teas have two values—an <i>Intrinsic</i> or real value, and a
<i>Commercial</i> or market value; quality, strength and flavor
constituting the first, the latter being more often based
on style, appearance, supply and fluctuations in price.
So that in their selection for commercial purposes four
leading features are to be considered—Leaf, Style,
Liquor and Flavor. The drawing and drinking qualities
of the tea in the cup are paramount to the style and
appearance of the leaf in the hand, as many teas, though
rough-looking and coarse in “make” or style, draw and
drink well in the infusion. There are five principal
methods of testing the merits of a tea:—</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>By Style or Appearance.</span></b>—Which, though not invariably
an indication of merit, has still considerable to do
with the value and quality of a tea. Choice teas of all
kinds are however, handsomely made and stylish in
appearance, that is, compactly if not artistically curled,
twisted, folded or rolled, according to its make, and all
teas being small and fine in proportion to their youth and
tenderness, the ripest and most “sappy” curling up
tightest and retaining their form longest, consequently
the younger and fresher the leaves the richer, more juicy
and succulent the tea. If it be Green tea of the Imperial
or Gunpowder order the leaf is hard-rolled and
“shotty,” regular in make, bright natural green in color,
very uniform and pleasing in general appearance. But
if of the Hyson or Young Hyson sorts, the leaf will be
well and evenly curled or twisted, the latter being almost
“wirey” in texture and of the same hue as the former.
If Black, of the Oolong or Congou variety, the leaf will
be finely made, “silky” or “crapy” in texture and varying
in size from small to medium, artistically twisted and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>attractive to the eye. Old and inferior teas, on the other
hand, will be large, rough and loosely rolled or curled,
in proportion to their age, quality and picking, and being
partially or entirely devoid of “sap” or succulence, they
are correspondingly thin, coarse or flavorless in the infused
state.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>By Feeling.</span></b>—Judging a sample of tea by feeling is
applicable more to the curled, twisted or rolled sorts,
such as Oolongs, Congous, Souchongs and Hyson
teas. If the leaves of a tea of these makes, so tested, be
really choice they will be found smooth, crisp and elastic
in the hand, and capable of resisting a gentle but firm
pressure, yielding rather than snapping or breaking under
it. But if old and “sapless,” they will be found rough
and “chaffy” to the touch, very brittle, cracking easily
and crumbling under the same conditions, making much
dust.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>By Smelling.</span></b>—By blowing or breathing hard upon
a sample of tea and then quickly catching the odor emitted
from it a fair estimate of its general character and value
may be arrived at. To judge by this method, however,
an acquaintance with the distinctive flavors and peculiarities
of the various sorts and grades will be first necessary.
This knowledge is best acquired by adopting as a type or
“standard” a sample of the tea to be matched and educating
this sense to its flavor and aroma. It is not for a
moment claimed that this test will be at all times accurate
or reliable, and only a general estimate can be formed,
especially if suffering from a cold, in which case its
true character or value cannot be even approximated.
Again, many teas that may be “new and nosey” in
the hand will be “thin and flat” in the cup, the
“flashy” or evanescent flavor passing off rapidly on
infusion.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span><b><span class='large'>By Masticating.</span></b>—A close and almost accurate
estimate of the character and value of a tea can be
formed by chewing a few of the leaves. With this
method a good tea may be recognized by the ready manner
in which the leaves almost dissolve in the mouth on slight
mastication, becoming quickly reduced to a “pasty”
consistency if young, tender and succulent, the “sap”
or juice yielded will be abundant, pungent and pleasing
to the taste. If of the Green or Japan variety the
residue will be of a bright, natural-green color on removal,
rich olive-green if Oolong, of a rich reddish-brown tint
if Congou and dark-red if India or Ceylon. But if composed
of old, inferior, spent or spurious leaves they
will be found difficult to masticate, being dry, “chippy,”
sapless and tough in texture, yielding little or no juice
according to its age and inferiority. Whatever little is
expressed being “wild,” “weedy,” “woody,” “herby,”
“mousey,” “grassy” or “metallic” and bitterly astringent
to the taste, the residue being dark in color, coarse or
granulated on removal. This test should not be resorted
to only on extreme occasions, as a too frequent chewing
of tea-leaves, owing to the tannin in their composition,
severely affects the nervous system and ultimately the
digestive organs.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>By Infusing or Drawing</span></b>—Is unquestionably the
most reliable and satisfactory method of testing or
appraising tea, being the one adopted by all brokers,
experts and dealers as the most conclusive and least injurious
to the system. For this purpose a number of
small porcelain cups, scales and half-dime weight is
requisite, together with a perfectly clean kettle and
freshly distilled or filtered water, briskly boiled. Take
the weight of the half-dime of leaves and mark the cups
to correspond with the samples under examination, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>pour on the briskly boiling water and allow it to draw
from three to five minutes by the watch, first seeing
that the cups are thoroughly clean and dry, or, better
still, heated or rinsed with boiling water before weighing
or putting in the tea, as cups used for drawing other sorts
of tea will impart the flavor of those previously tested to
the last if not properly washed and dried before using
again; also see that the water is <i>briskly</i> boiling before
pouring it on the leaves, as water not properly boiling
will cause the leaves to float. If large cups are used the
quantity of leaves should be increased proportionately,
say to that of a dime in weight for an ordinary tea-cup.
It is customary with some brokers and tea-testers to cover
the cups with a lid or saucer during infusion, but this
precaution is not absolutely necessary; still it has its
benefits, as it prevents the vapor and aroma from escaping,
both valuable factors in the exact testing of tea.
The water used should be as soft and pure as can be
obtained; boiled briskly and used <i>only</i> at the boiling point.
That is, it must boil, but not overboil, for if it be allowed
to do so for even a few minutes it will not extract the
full strength and flavor of the leaves. Expert tea-testers
are most particular in this respect, watching their kettles
so that the water may be used the minute it boils, and if
any water remains in the kettle it is poured off and
refilled with fresh water before using again, as the effect
of using water that has been boiled a second time is the
same as that of water which has been overboiled. In
testing teas by infusing or drawing five important
points are to be considered: Body, Color, Strength,
Flavor and Aroma of the Liquor, the tea combining
these qualities in the highest degree proving, of course,
the best. On removing the lids, if used, inhale the
vapor slowly, noting its aroma at the same time; next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>stir the leaves gently with a spoon for a few minutes,
and smell them occasionally, also noting their odor; by
which time the tea will be cool enough to taste. Before
doing so, however, observe the color of the liquor—an
important factor in tea—a rich straw, golden or corn-yellow
colored liquor, generally, if not invariably, indicating
a tea of fine quality, except it be of the Congou, India
or Ceylon variety. Next, taste the tea by sipping it so as to
strike the palate, but do not swallow, as it kills the taste,
and noting its body, flavor, strength and pungency while
so doing, comparing it with the tea required or to be
“matched.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But while a clear, bright, sparkling liquor denotes
a fine tea it does not always determine its body or
strength, as many light-liquored teas are full and round
in body, pungent and “snappy;” others again, though
dark and heavy in liquor, are yet devoid of strength and
flavor, the liquor of old and inferior teas being invariably
dark, thick or “muddy” in color, and lacking
in briskness and flavor. After an opinion has been
formed of the liquor in all its relations, next examine the
infused leaves with regard to their size, color, form, texture
and condition, as all these points have an indirect
bearing on the age, quality, character and value of the
tea under examination. The infused leaves of fine, pure
teas range from small to medium in size, perfect or nearly
so in shape, regular and symmetrical in form, uniform and
unbroken in appearance. While the infused leaf of low-grade
and adulterated teas is large and dark-red or brown
in color, broken, irregular and different in size, form
and color from the true tea-leaf. The smaller, brighter
and more symmetrical the infused leaf, the higher the
grade, and consequently the greater the value of the tea,
that of fine Oolongs being olive-green, with slightly brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>or “burnt” edges, Congous and Souchongs rich reddish-brown,
India and Ceylons, “salmony-red.” Scented teas
possessing a small olive-green infused leaf. In Green teas
those yielding a bright, sparkling, “amber”-colored
liquor, with small or medium infused leaf and presenting
an unbroken and uniform appearance are the best; the
same rules that govern in the selection of Green teas
also applying to Japans.</p>

<p class='c009'>The value of tea commercially, depends principally
upon the character and flavor of the infusion and also
on the aroma imparted to it by the volatile oil, which is
not generally estimated by chemists owing to the imperfect
methods of obtaining it and the difficulty attending
the operation. But commercially the value of a tea is
based on the amount of “extract” it yields as well as on
the quantity of theine and tannin contained therein. Tea-testers
and experts on the other hand take no account of
theine, which is almost tasteless, but which is at the same
time physiologically the most important constituent of
tea. And so far as total extract is concerned Congou
teas are inferior in quantity to Oolongs, Greens and
Japans, while the latter in turn yield a larger percentage
of theine than either India or Ceylons, notwithstanding
that it is claimed that they yield less. Yet it must be
admitted that a deeper color is imparted to the infusion
by India and Ceylon teas, and that they are also of greater
strength than China and Japan teas, in fullness (not delicacy)
of flavor, the former claim is not borne out by either
analysis or testing. There is also no uniform relation existing
between the chemical composition of teas and their
commercial value, as the percentage of extract determined
by a half-hour’s boiling of the leaves in 100 parts of distilled
water bears in China and Japan teas particularly
a more uniform relation to the price, although the total
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>extract obtained by exhausting the leaf is very irregular.
This result is also quite in accord with the fact that the
finer and more valuable qualities of all teas are to be
found only in the youngest and tenderest leaves, the
decline from the finer to the lower grades in the amount
of theine dissolved being also noteworthy as showing the
power to yield nearly all their theine, the latter doing
so only to a limited extent under the same treatment.
But although these results show the difference in the
drawing qualities of all the various kinds of tea, yet they
are not sufficiently uniform to make such analysis the
basis for calculating the price of tea. It is evident,
however, that the volatile or essential oil—to which tea
owes it flavor and aroma—plays a more important part
than any of the other constituents in determining the
commercial value of tea. Again, it must be noted the
strength and flavor of the infusion is as much due to the
character of the water used in drawing as to any other
cause, the quantity of tannin extracted by soft water
being greater than that obtained by the use of hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>The taste for tea being an acquired and not a natural
one, it necessarily follows that persons who have been
accustomed to a certain variety or flavor in tea, want
that particular kind and will be dissatisfied if any other
is given them. Consumers of wine have their fancies, so
have users of ale or beer—one prefers a dry, another a
sweet wine—one a mild and another a bitter beer. This
being the case, it becomes essential to the success of the
tea-dealer to study and learn what variety of tea or what
particular flavor his customers have been accustomed to
before attempting to cater to it. This is a question somewhat
difficult to answer, as not only is there a wide
difference of taste in tea in the different parts of the
country, but in every large town or city alone the varieties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and flavors in demand are so numerous and various that
most dealers are compelled to mark out a distinct line
for themselves. In the larger cities this is the most
successful course to pursue, particularly if the kind and
quality of the tea be kept regular and uniform the year
round, as it secures the return again and again of the
same customers for that particular tea, and thus keeps a
business always steady and progressive. Even away
from the larger cities it is well to follow this course, but
while at first it may be found advisable to keep close
to the established tea-taste of the section, a gradual
change may be found good policy, as a dealer can
by a little effort educate his trade in time to a particular
variety or flavor of tea, for after all is said, and as
remarked before, the taste for a certain tea is only an
acquired one. He may, for instance, be selling a heavy-bodied
Amoy or dark-leaved Foochow Oolong and
suddenly change off to a fine Formosa. In such a
case his trade would be very apt to find fault at first,
notwithstanding that the latter may be choicer and more
expensive than the former, but by ignoring the complaints
at the beginning and continuing to insist upon their taking
it, eventually succeed in educating them to acquire a
taste for it. Still the importance of retaining and maintaining
the quality and flavor to which his customers
are longest accustomed cannot be overestimated, for no
dealer can afford to jeopardize his business or can expect
success if his teas one month consist of fine flavored
teas, the next month of heavy and dull and the third of
a sharp and pungent kind. To maintain this necessary
regularity, must be admitted, is difficult, as no two consecutive
importations of tea are exactly alike although
selected from the same picking or chosen from those
grown in the same district the variations may still be so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>wide as to cause dissatisfaction among consumers. Therefore
it becomes essential to the success of the dealer to
pay particular attention to the quality of his tea, as
there is no article he deals in which will attract trade or
retain it longer than good tea, a fine tea creating more
comment in a town or neighborhood than any other article
used at table and if customers once lose confidence in either
the ability or honesty of the dealer they will be repelled
rather than attracted, it being next to impossible to get
them back again. So that it does not pay a dealer to
make any mistake in the selection of his teas, such mistake
proving fatal to drawing or holding trade. Poor teas will
drive more customers away in a week than can be made
in a year; it is therefore much better and more profitable
in the long run to sell only good teas at a smaller margin
of profit than to sell poor teas at a larger one. Many
dealers make use of the argument, “I bought this tea so
much cheaper and my customers do not appear to notice
the difference; they do not complain.” This may be true,
but it is delusive, as people seldom complain; they go
elsewhere and get better value. Every community becomes
accustomed to drinking a particular description of
tea and is quick to discover any change in the character
and flavor of any tea that may be substituted for it, thereby
becoming dissatisfied notwithstanding that even a higher-priced
tea, of different character, may be given them. For
this reason the dealer will do well to keep as close to the
grade and variety in use there and as nearly uniform as
possible at all times maintaining a “standard.” To do
this effectually it will be necessary for him to study and
learn as near as he can the particular grade and flavor
his trade prefers, which is best accomplished by first
trying them with various kinds until he has found that
which is best suited to a majority of his customers; having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>succeeded in this, let him stick to that particular kind.
Again, as any one variety will not suit all tastes, he can
next endeavor to find a tea adapted to the minority by
the same method, reserving and keeping these two or
more kinds as the case may be. It is much easier
to describe what teas to avoid than those to select or
what may be best adapted to a particular section, as good
tea of all kinds will sell at any time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again, some sections of the country possess great
advantages over others in the testing and preparation of
tea for use, as, wherever the water is soft and pure, much
better results are obtained from the infusion by a given
quantity of leaves, owing to the fact that such water dissolves
more rapidly and extracts a larger amount of the
<i>theine</i> than hard or muddy water. The coarse as well as
fine properties of the tea are also “brought out” more
prominently by the action of the former, it being for this
reason that “high-fired,” “toasty” and “tarry” teas so
much in favor in some sections will not sell at all in
others where the water is soft as a rule, and why China
Congous are best appreciated in sections where the water
is soft, as the natural delicacy of their unique “fruity”
flavor is best extracted by that kind of water and to a
greater extent than is the flavor of most other varieties.</p>

<p class='c009'>The distinctive flavors which characterize the different
varieties of tea may be summed up in a single technical
term—Amoys are “nutty,” Foochows are “mellow,”
Formosas are “fragrant,” Green teas are “pungent,”
Pekoes are “piquant,” Congous are “fruity,” Souchongs
are “tarry,” Japans are “mealy,” Scented teas are “aromatic,”
Indias are “malty,” Ceylons are “toasty” and
Javas are “sour.” Oolongs of an “herby,” “weedy”
or “wild” flavor should be avoided, as they are principally
mixed with Ankois. <a id='tn169'></a>Pingsueys, Cantons and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>doctored Green teas should be tabooed altogether; if
cheap Green teas must be had, procure a low-grade
Moyune regardless of its appearance, as it will give
better satisfaction than the finest of the foregoing. Japans
of a “fishy,” “grassy” or “metallic” flavor should also
be shunned, as they will be found dear at almost any price.
Congous of a “woody,” “mousey” or “smoky” flavor
and too “tarry” Souchongs are also good teas to leave
alone, while Canton and Macao Scented teas should never
find a place in the dealer’s stock. Low-grade India, Ceylon
and Javas are either “raw,” “uncooked,” “baked,”
“burnt” or “sour” in flavor, and decay very rapidly
being unfit for use after a few weeks’ exposure. In
brief, do not handle any old, raw, grassy, weedy,
woody, smoky, fishy or brassy flavored teas under
any circumstances. There is no satisfaction in them
to the consumer and no profit in them to the dealer.
Keep good teas only and get your price. It pays best
in the end.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tea-dealer with any desire to extend or even
retain his trade should no more attempt to sell poor,
inferior, unclean or damaged tea than a butcher to
endeavor to sell tainted meat or a baker to give his
customers sour bread. The offense may not at first seem
so objectionable, but the verdict of the public will be the
same in each case, and the practical manner in which his
customers will manifest this opinion will be to let such
dealer severely alone. Good clean teas can nearly
always be purchased for a few cents per pound above
the price of the “trash” now offered in the American
market and masquerading under the name of tea, being
nothing more or less than a gross libel on the “fascinating
beverage.” By this mistaken policy of trying to save
three or four cents, the seed is not only sown for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>future ruin of the dealer himself, but it also produces the
effect of disgusting the public and casting discredit on
tea as an article of food. While, on the other hand, if the
dealer make a comparatively small but necessary sacrifice
for the sake of future gain by selling <i>Tea that is tea</i> and
be content with a fair and legitimate profit, satisfaction will
be given to his customers, trade fostered and the consumption
of this now most important food auxiliary
increased at least two-fold in this country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Standard Chop,” or “celebrated district” teas, should
always be selected when possible, and “first-crop” for high-grade
teas, as first-crop teas are invariably superior (except
in the case of Formosas) to the later pickings in flavor,
aroma and keeping properties, due to the larger amount
of theine and volatile oil which they contain, and possessing
every quality except weight for which tea is valued
or appreciated. To do this it will be necessary for the
dealer to ascertain which “chop” is the best and which
district has yielded the best picking during the current
season, thereby making quality as well as quantity the
test of excellence. For, as with wheat and other
crops, the tea crop also varies according to the season
and curing; some years being highly successful in one
district while it may be a comparative failure in another<a id='tn171'></a>.
The “Tong-lees” may be heavy and flavory this year,
thin and flavorless the next; while the “Tong-mows,”
or some other “chop,” inferior in leaf and liquor
last season may possess all the most desirable qualities
this. Green teas, Japans, Congous, Souchongs, India,
Ceylons and all varieties of tea being equally subject to
these variations So that the advantages to be derived
from a careful selection of the best “chop” and “district”
teas of the season, with but slight consideration, will be
manifest to the intelligent dealer in tea.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>The tastes of communities differing so widely in the
various sections of the country, the dealer must study
and learn the particular variety and flavor best adapted to
the locality or town in which he is doing business, as a
tea that may give general satisfaction in one section may
not suit at all in another. But generally in mining, milling
or manufacturing districts or among working classes
in cities, heavy-bodied Amoys and dark-leaved Foo-chous
will be found the most popular. The taste for
China and Japan teas in this country is undoubtedly an
inherited one, but irrespective of this cause they are for the
vast majority of tea-drinkers peculiarly the most suitable
and best adapted, being softer, milder, richer, more
mellow and wholesome than either the India or Ceylon
growths, and it is only a cultivated and refined taste that
can appreciate them at their true worth. In a community
composed principally of Irish, English or Scotch,
thick “fruity” Congous, heavy-bodied “tarry” Souchongs,
Capers, Pekoes, India and Ceylon teas or combinations
formed from these varieties will prove the most
satisfactory. While Green teas are most in demand in
the Southern States. Oolongs in the Eastern and Middle,
Foochows and Formosas being chiefly sold in the
larger seaboard cities, Amoys in the principal manufacturing
districts, Japans in the Pacific and Northwestern,
India, Ceylons and teas of the Congou order,
in Irish, English and other foreign settlements.</p>

<p class='c009'>All teas after ripening have a tendency to decay, some
teas not keeping as well as others, there being a great
difference in the time that some will keep before the
deterioration becomes pronounced in comparison with
that of others. And tea also possessing an natural aptitude
to become impregnated with the odor of any high
or foul-smelling article near which it may be placed, care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>should be taken to keep it away from such commodities
as fish, soap, coal-oil, molasses and spices, as it quickly
absorbs all pungent odors. Yet I have known of teas
that were imported with or stored in close proximity
to wine, oranges, lemons and even camphor to be improved
in flavor, more particularly when very lightly
tainted by such odors. Still teas should be kept as much
as possible from the light and air, particularly in damp
or humid weather, as the oxydizing influences of the
atmosphere has a more or less deleterious effect upon
them. They should never be sold out of freshly-painted
bins or newly-japanned tea-caddies, being much better, at
all times, to deal them out of the original packages, replacing
the lead and lid when through. The most successful
tea-dealers I have met invariably sell them in this manner.
Do not keep your teas too close to a fire or stove, a dry,
cool atmosphere of moderate temperature is always best.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tea-market fluctuating considerably in the course of
the year, it will be necessary for the dealer to understand
something of the law of supply and demand, which
affects the fluctuation to a considerable extent, before he
can make profitable purchases. The dealer who is
best “posted” in his business makes the best business
man, so that the tea-dealer who not only understands
the article he is dealing in, but whose knowledge
and discrimination enable him “to buy the right tea
at the right time” possesses advantages over his competitors,
the value of which can hardly be overestimated.
Each season, on the “first arrivals,” high
prices are paid, and if there be a brisk demand those full
prices are continued for some time, after which follows a
dull, drooping or listless market, from which but little
satisfaction can be obtained; but should the demand on
arrival be light, through dealers holding off for better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>terms, the prices rapidly decline to a more reasonable
level, it then becomes comparatively steady. When this
is the case the decline occurs about the middle of
September, and dealers will do well to take advantage of
the choice selections of teas that arrive during the
months of October and November. For the better buying
of teas at this time it will also be found necessary to
note the supply very closely, as during heavy shipments
the market is nearly always easier, while, when the
arrivals are light, the tea-market is higher. These
points are deserving the special attention of the successful
tea-dealer.</p>

<p class='c009'>For some years past a new development of the tea
trade has, to the surprise of the older wholesale and retail
dealers, assumed a good deal of prominence, for if the
advertisement columns of newspapers, startling placards
at railroad stations and on fences form any criterion, the
public are taking a liking to teas put up in pound and
half-pound packages under fancy names—the latter having
no relation whatever to any country, district or locality
where the teas are grown. That the public should, to a
certain extent, buy anything persistently forced upon its
attention is perhaps possible, but tea put up in tin, lead
or paper packets would seem a somewhat hopeless
direction in which to attempt to draw the public taste.
Tea in bulk, in the original lead-lined chests, undoubtedly
keeps better, as it preserves the strength, flavor
and aroma of the tea longer than when exposed to the
oxydizing influence of the atmosphere, particularly
in this climate, so that during transference into the tin,
paper or unseasoned lead packet, ornamented with a
“showy” label which the more gorgeous the more apt
it is to communicate a taste of the ink, paint, glue or
material in which it is packed to the tea they are intended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>to adorn. Again, these packets, labels and labor add as
much as five to eight cents to the cost of the tea, together
with the expense of flaunting them before the eyes of
the public, which must be simply enormous. The public
generally are ignorant in such matters, and the legitimate
dealer might look with amused surprise on the apparent
demand for packet teas if it were not that an increasing
number of dealers are adopting the new system. Engaged
as most of the grocers are in trying to stop the plague of
all sorts of proprietary goods which yield them so little
profit and make them the servants only of the manufacturers
and proprietors, it is astonishing, to say the
least, that other dealers should be found who are adopting
the same system with tea. A grocer cannot manufacture
spices or sugar, grow wine, distil whisky or brew beer,
but <i>he can, as generations of grocers have done before him,
sell good tea out of an honest tea-chest,—or caddy—and
make a respectable living, if not money, out of it for
himself and not for others, while serving the public well at
the same time</i>. Surely, the attitude of the grocers on this
question should not be one of doubt, as they have it in their
power to make it clear to the public that <i>they can sell
cheaper, better <a id='tn175'></a>and fresher teas of their own, and with a
far better guarantee of the source of supply named or
adhered to than if a paper or metallic packet with a fancy
label, however attractive, is trusted to</i>. Again, there can be
no valid reason why every grocer, if he sees fit, should not
put his own teas up and offer them under his own name
and brand upon it, if his patrons should desire, a fancy and
costly packet with no other advantages attaching to it.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>TEA-BLENDING AS A FINE ART.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Comparatively little is known of the art or principle
of mixing or blending of teas in this country, American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>dealers and consumers alike being averse to the practice,
regarding it as about on a parity with other methods of
sophistication. Such objections are entirely erroneous,
as it is an acknowledged principle that a combination of
different varieties of wheat make better flour, the same
being true of coffees and other articles of diet. So
that the practice of blending teas, if properly understood
and skillfully performed, would prove a more satisfactory
and profitable one to both consumer and dealer.
The object is not, as the public may imagine, to lower the
quality or reduce the cost to the dealer, but simply to
produce better tea and obtain a finer and more desirable
flavor than that yielded by any single variety, one
giving better satisfaction to the consumer at a more
moderate price and at the same time allowing a larger
margin of profit to the dealer. As an illustration, a
dealer may be selling a tea possessing a suitable flavor,
but be lacking in body or light in liquor, whereas, by
adding to it one or two other teas possessing these
qualities the defect is rectified and a full-flavored heavy-bodied
tea is produced and the two latter also improved.
It follows then that by the judicious blending or mixing
of three to five teas, differing in variety and grade, a more
uniform and pleasing tea, heavier in body, richer in liquor
and flavor can be obtained by this principle at a more
moderate cost.</p>

<p class='c009'>The idea of blending teas originally arose from the
experience incidentally gained that a beverage more
pleasing, satisfactory and less costly, could be produced
from a number of different varieties and grades judiciously
and scientifically combined, than could otherwise
be obtained from any single sort when used alone. No
sooner was this experience confirmed than “mixing” or
blending of teas was generally resorted to by many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>those who had the dispensing of the article to the public.
Some dealers had marked success in this branch of the
business, while others again who attempted it failed completely
in their efforts to produce any satisfactory results,
the end accomplished being, instead of an improvement,
an injury to the quality and value of the tea combined,
often to such an extent that ordinary plain teas would
have pleased better at less labor and cost. The cause of
this failure was due alone to the want of that necessary
training and experience which would enable the dealer
to understand the characteristics and affinities of both
the teas which are improved and those which are deteriorated
by blending together. The knowledge and skill
required for this particular branch of the tea business is
only attained in perfection by numerous tests and constant
experiments which are performed by mixing from
two to five or more samples of tea, differing in variety,
character and quality, alternately changing, altering and
substituting them until the dealer has succeeded in producing
a tea unique in character, the body, flavor and
aroma of which will prove more pleasing and satisfactory
to a majority of his patrons, at a more moderate cost,
identified with himself and differing in every respect from
that of any tea offered by his competitors. And after he
has succeeded in his efforts he must be careful to keep
it as uniform as possible, never allowing even his employees
to know of what teas his combination is formed.
By following these precautions he becomes noted for keeping
a tea that cannot be secured elsewhere and one which,
after his customers become once educated to that especial
flavor, will not be satisfied with any other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The world moves” and the American tea dealer
should move with it, as time and experience has proved
beyond dispute that skilful and judicious Tea-blending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>will be found to amply repay the study and labor bestowed
on it. The chief and only difficulty existing in the art
lays in first finding a combination that will please a majority
of your customers. The primary object and fundamental
principle should be to obtain in a consolidated
form, harmony, strength, pungency, flavor and piquancy
and at the same time to effect these results with the smallest
possible outlay. To accomplish these results three
important points must be carefully studied: First, to
learn the taste of your customers; second, to ascertain
what teas combine best to suit this taste; third, to find
out to what extent the component parts of a once adopted
and satisfactory blend may be varied in case of difficulty
to secure the same kind of teas for future use. These
results can be best secured only by proper selecting,
weighing, regulating and arranging the proportionate
quantities and different qualities in such a manner as to
obtain the best results at the smallest possible outlay. So
that before proceeding to produce a specific blend or
mixture the dealer must consider well the descriptions
which will combine satisfactorily and these that will not
unite harmoniously, as teas that are not improved are
certain to be deteriorated by blending.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief art in successful tea-blending is to combine
body, strength and some particular and distinct flavor in
one, so as to please the majority of that portion of the public
for whom the tea is prepared, and at the same time so
arrange its constituent parts in such a manner that this
desirable result may be obtained at the smallest possible
outlay. To satisfactorily accomplish this object the
dealer must first learn to understand thoroughly the
taste of those for whom the tea is intended, and secondly,
to study what teas will combine best to please their
taste, as well as to know how far the component parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the blend can be varied without seriously affecting its
regularity so that advantage may be taken of the
cheapness of any special variety or grade of tea. The
importance of retaining the uniformity of a blend, when
once a satisfactory combination has been discovered,
must also not be overlooked. Other combinations may
be as good, or better, their component parts skilfully
arranged and properly mixed, but unless one standard
blend is decided on, and then sedulously maintained,
fault will be found and customers go elsewhere. This
difficulty is best avoided by paying proper attention to
the selection of the teas constituting the blend, having
each sample matched as close as possible before purchasing,
as well as by not changing more than one of the
teas composing the blend at a time when it is the intention
to alter the character of the tea. When a large
number of teas are used in the formation of a blend, the
alteration of any—provided that a particular one is fairly
matched—will effect but a comparatively slight variation
in its general character. But, if more than one change
is to be made let it be done by degrees, for, if the changes
in the various teas forming the blend are made gradually,
few, if any, will detect the alteration.</p>

<p class='c009'>The proper Blending of tea is an art that cannot be
correctly taught in books or easily learned, it must be
acquired by study, experiment and experience alone.
Like all other knowledge there is “no royal road to it”
the dealer must endeavor to learn himself, to understand
the flavors, characters and affinities of the teas that will
be either improved or deteriorated by combination, as
no absolute rule can be substituted for the practical
knowledge so acquired. In the proper blending of teas
it is essential also that all combinations should be judiciously
and thoroughly mixed together, the leaves of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>component parts being selected with due regard to size,
color and uniformity and broken as little as possible so
that all may harmonize well together. It is a serious
mistake to imagine that the successful or profitable
blending of tea consists solely of an indiscriminate or
injudicious heaping together carelessly and indifferently
of two or more varieties of tea in one homogeneous
mass without the least regard to quantities, qualities,
affinities, affiliations or assimilations of leaf, liquor,
character or flavor of the component parts. On the
contrary, the art consists in combining the two or
more different varieties or grades of tea forming the
combination in an intelligent, judicious and scientific
manner so as to yield an unique and particular tea of
uniform quality, strength, flavor and pungency at a given
price, pleasing and satisfactory to the greatest number and
maintaining its standard at all times and under all
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while it is admitted that it is next to impossible to
understand tea-blending thoroughly without an apprenticeship
to the business and that the combinations
that may be formed from it are almost <a id='tn180'></a>kaleidoscopic in
their range, requiring a separate work. Still, even a
novice need not spoil good tea by injudicious mixing, as
a little study and a few simple rules carefully followed,
although they cannot be substituted for years of experience
in such a difficult branch, will prevent any
serious error and ensure a fair measure of success. It
must be understood at the outset that all combinations
of tea, as a rule, must depend upon the character, flavor
and grade of the tea most in demand in the section or
neighborhood of the dealer, that particular variety forming
the base or foundation of the blends prepared, that
is, it must dominate the combination. To illustrate, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Oolongs be most in demand, the blend must be composed
of from one-half to two-thirds Oolong, and so on with Congous,
Greens, Japans or India sorts, as the case may be.
Before proceeding to describe any particular blends it
will be necessary to name the descriptions of tea that will
not combine satisfactorily, as well as those which will
amalgamate most harmoniously with each other. The
former are described first, because <i>teas not improved are
certain to be deteriorated by blending</i>. One of the first and
fundamental rules in tea-blending is not to allow unclean
or tainted tea, even in small quantities, to be introduced
into any combination, which rule should be as rigidly
adhered to in the low-priced blends as well in the higher
grades, so that all “weedy,” “herby” and “wild” flavored
Oolongs should be eschewed in blending.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this country, where the taste for Oolong and Japan
teas appear to be an inherited one, and where there is
every prospect of their continuing to be the favorite teas
with American consumers for all time to come, the best
results are to be obtained from combinations formed of
these varieties. Ripe, juicy and succulent “first crop”
Foochows make the best foundation for all blends in this
country. First-crop Formosas losing their fragrance
almost as rapidly as Japans. Third-crop, or “Autumn-leaf”
Formosas that have been well-fired, and which, unlike
most other varieties, improve rather than deteriorate
with time, becoming more “mellow” for at least the first
year after arrival, rank next for this purpose, the action
of the atmosphere in exposure bringing out their fragrance
more fully, and at the same time causing their high-toast
or burnt flavor to disappear. Bold-leaf, sweet-drawing
Amoys; dark-leaved, full-liquoring Foochows, and
large-leaf “nosey” Formosas and thick, sweet, “fruity”
Congous make the best <a id='tn181'></a>foundation for all tea blends, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>for the purpose of imparting a rich fragrance to any combination
a choice or “pekoed” Formosa will be found the
most desirable and valuable, its high character and great
piquancy being possessed by no other variety grown. A
small quantity of a really choice or even tolerably good
Formosa tea will penetrate and dominate a blend, making
itself felt and tasting through it. Its value consisting in its
delicate “cow-slip” aroma and great piquancy, mellowing
the liquor and giving a rich “bouquet” to the infusion.
It is also a tea that when once tea-drinkers become educated
or attached to its matchless qualities are ever after
hard to please with any other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Low-grade and artificially-colored Pan-fired Japans,
owing to their usually “brassy” or “fishy” flavor, and
well-known tendency to early decay, which has a highly
detrimental effect on the other teas should be avoided,
while new, “mealy,” Basket-fired Japans are especially
adapted for all Black tea blends, as they impart a peculiarly
rich color and tone to the liquor and a very
pleasing mellowness to the flavor of the combination,
but should never form the base of the blend. “Old,”
“musty,” “mousey,” or “smoky” Congous, too “high-fired”
and excessively “tarry” Souchongs should also
be avoided altogether, as they invariably detract from or
destroy the flavor and aroma of the finer kinds used in
the blend, their deleterious effects being felt through the
entire combination, and all “dusty” and “stemmy” teas
in particular, for while some tea-drinkers will bear with a
small quantity of these most objectionable features in tea,
the vast majority will protest, as it is next to impossible
to prevent dust and stems from finding their way into
the tea-cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>The appended formulas are not given with the intention
of laying down any fixed or positive rules, but simply as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>suggesting a code that may be useful to those who are
compelled to blend tea without ever having an opportunity
of thoroughly mastering the art. Only two to five
varieties, at current prices, are used, in order to illustrate
the principle more simply, as more complex combinations
should not be attempted until the dealer has
acquired that practical knowledge attained only by
experiment and experience.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>SPECIMEN BLACK TEA BLENDS.</h4>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>1. (Low-priced)</span></b>—Suitable for restaurant and general
trade where a cheap, heavy-bodied and strong-flavored
tea is the main consideration. Base 10 pounds
Amoy Oolong at 20 cents, 2 pounds Oonfa or other
dark-leaved Congou at 20 cents. Average cost 20
cents. In the Oolong forming this blend a little coarseness
may be tolerated, but “herby” and “weedy” teas
must be avoided, as what strength is needed is supplied by
the Congou, which must be free from any suspicion of
oldness. The color of the leaf, however, must be black,
so as to harmonize with that of the Oolong. If not
sufficiently pungent, the addition of 1 pound low-priced
Assam will supply that defect.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>2. (Medium)</span></b>—Base 10 pound Foochow Oolong at
25 cents, 2 pounds basket-fired Japan at 25 cents and 1
pound Ning-chow Congou. Average cost 25 cents.
This will be found a popular tea in a mining or manufacturing
district where a smooth-flavored substantial
tea is required, or 10 pounds Ningyong Oolong at about
20 cents, 2 pounds Congou at 24 cents and 1 pound
Assam at 24 cents may be tried if the former should
not prove entirely satisfactory. This combination makes
a heavy-bodied, dark-colored “grippy” tea; one that will
stand a second drawing and still be strong and flavory.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>The Ningyong used in this combination should be light,
clean and as sweet-drawing as can be had at the price
and the Congou as “high-toasted” as possible, and if the
Assam be “pekoed” so much the better.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>3. (Medium to Fine)</span></b>—Is a tea that has been found
to give almost universal satisfaction in a district composed
of a working class who appreciate smoothness and richness
to weight or strength, and is formed as follows: 10
pounds fine dark-leaved Foochow Oolong at 30, 2
pounds Basket-fired Japan at 25 and 1 pound Moning
Congou at 25 cents. Average cost 29 cents. Or where
Oolongs are most in demand 10 pounds Foochow, 10
pounds Formosa and 5 pounds Basket-fired to mellow
or tone the combination may be substituted, 5 pounds of
a true Moyune Young Hyson to replace the Japan when
a Green tea is preferred in the blend, or, better still, added
to it. The Foochow in this combination while possessing
a full body is yet lacking in aroma which is imparted
by the Formosa, the Japan supplying the mellowness and
Young Hyson the requisite pungency.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>4. (Fine to Choice)</span></b>—A Blend like the following will
be found to give universal satisfaction in any locality,
being full, strong, round, smooth and fragrant, one entirely
foreign in flavor and aroma to that of any single tea
in common use: Base 10 pounds choice “third crop”
Formosa at 35 cents, 1 pound fine Ning-chow Congou
at 30 cents and 1 pound Yamashiro Basket-fired Japan
at 30 cents, for which an equal quantity of Nankin
Imperial may be substituted when it becomes necessary
to vary the combination, or, better still, added to it if a
Green tea is desired in it by the customer.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>5. (Choice)</span></b>—Is a combination that will yield a most
pleasing tea to suit a mercantile or professional trade
having been fully tested and proved popular among these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>classes in Philadelphia and vicinity. Foundation: 10
pounds “first chop” high-district Foochow Oolong at
40 cents, 10 pounds choice “pekoe-tipped” Formosa at
40 cents and 5 pounds “Spring-picked” Basket-fired
about same figures. A blend composed of these three
varieties cannot be approached in drawing and drinking
qualities by that of any single tea costing 60 cents.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>SPECIMEN GREEN TEA BLENDS.</h4>

<p class='c015'>The combinations to be made from Green teas are not
many, being limited in range.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>6. (Low-Priced)</b>—A heavy drawing, thick-liquored
full-flavored tea can be prepared from a combination of
equal parts of a cheap but clean, sweet-drawing Moyune
Hyson or Twankay and Japan Nibs, when a cheap all-Green
tea is required, as both these teas drink much
better in conjunction than when either is used alone, the
Japan mellowing and otherwise enriching the China
tea.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>7. (Medium)</span></b>—Base 20 pounds fair Foochow, 5 pounds
Moyune Young Hyson, and 5 pounds Sun-dried Japan,
make a unique and popular blend in some sections where
the taste for Young Hysons is still extant, but where
Imperials are preferred, the best results are obtained by
a mixing of ⅓ Imperial to ⅔ Foochow or other
Oolong.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>8. (Choice)</span></b>—Pan and Sun-dried Japans, in equal quantities,
always combine well with Hysons and Imperials,
imparting a clearness and briskness to the liquor, but in
the blending of green teas only true Moyunes should be
employed, as Cantons, Pingsueys and all artificially-colored
Green teas invariably injure and detract from the
combination in which they may be introduced, no matter
how fine the base and other constituent parts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>blend may be. Whenever low-priced Green teas are to
be used select a cheap, clean sweet-drawing Moyune
Imperial, Hyson, or even Twankay; they will give better
results than the better-made and higher-priced doubtful
sorts.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>SPECIMEN SCENTED TEA BLENDS.</h4>

<p class='c015'>One of the greatest delusions indulged in by the
novice in blending is that by using large and disproportionate
quantities of Scented teas in old, inferior or
damaged teas, under the erroneous impression that no
matter how thin, flat, tainted or otherwise defective they
may be it will “bring it up” and improve the flavor.
No greater mistake in blending could be made, for while
it is admitted that a small quantity of either Orange or
Flowery Pekoe will add to the value and flavor of a clean,
sweet Congou, but if used too freely makes it thin.
Scented teas of any kind cannot overpower, neutralize or
even modify the flavor of inferior or tainted teas, but, on
the contrary, will make them more so, particularly if Cantons
or Macaos be used. In this variety the best combinations
are always to be produced from teas of the
Congou and Souchong sorts, though not infrequently
they combine well with Oolongs in very moderate
quantities.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>9. (Low-Priced)</span></b>—Is a favorite blend in Scented tea
localities, particularly when the water is hard or cloudy.
To 10 pounds Saryune Congou add 1 pound Amoy
Foochow and 1 pound Orange Pekoe. The fullness and
smoothness of Saryune is unequalled for blending by
that of any other low-priced Congous, but must be
selected with care, as they are sometimes sour, often
rank and frequently dusty. For those preferring an
Oolong a cheap Saryune Oolong is best substituted for
the Congou in Scented blends, the affinity being stronger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>and more natural. Another good blend intended for the
same trade may be made from a combination of equal
proportions of a cheap but clean and free liquoring Black-leaf
Congou, Broken-leaf Assam and a Scented Caper—Foochow
if the price should permit.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>10. (Medium to Choice)</span></b>—Foundation: 10 pounds
Padrae Congou or Oolong, 2 pounds thick “fruity” Kiu-kiang
or delicate Kintuck and 1 pound Foochow
Orange or Flowery Pekoe make a fragrant and aromatic
tea in affiliation, the three flavors assimilating as if
governed by the law of gravitation. This will be found
a tea combining strength and delicacy at the same time
and well appreciated, as the chief difficulty in tea blending
is the production of these two qualities in the same
tea at the same time.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>INDO-CHINA TEA BLENDS.</h4>

<p class='c015'>The selection of India teas for blending is more difficult
than that of either China or Japan, most India teas
possessing a sharp, acrid or “baked” flavor not found in
the former kinds and the natural result of excess of
tannin and artificial curing. These “peculiarities” consumers
in this country greatly dislike, and to such an
extent that is only when the finest grades are used that
they can be neutralized, disguised or well-tempered with
the heavier bodied China sorts that they will use them at all.
For an “all-India blend” the best plan is to mix three
or four different district kinds together in equal quantities—a
strong, heavy Assam, a brisk and pungent Cachar, a
soft and juicy Deradoon and high-flavored Kangra or
Darjeeling; the latter will impart a distinctive tone to
the entire combination. But fairly excellent results may
also be obtained from a blend composed of equal parts
of Cachar and Darjeeling alone.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span><b><span class='large'>11. (Low-Priced)</span></b>—Is produced from proportionate
quantities of a heavy-drawing Broken-leaf Assam or
Darjeeling Oonfa Congou and Cachar Souchong, the
whole making a rough-looking but full-bodied, strong
and “grippy” tea.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>12. (Medium)</span></b>—Prepared from ½ Darjeeling Souchong,
½ <a id='tn188a'></a>Kee-mun or Ningchow Congou and ¼ Paklin.
Its predominant feature will be delicacy, though not
sufficiently so to please a general trade, the Paklin
detracting from the body, but imparting a rich, deep color
to the whole.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>13. (Choice)</span></b>—Is a good combination certain to be
appreciated by lovers of the India and Scented varieties,
is made from ½ of a brisk, pungent Assam Souchong,
¼ Ningchow or fruity Kintuck and ⅛ Foochow Caper<a id='tn188b'></a>.
The Ningchow should be grey-leaf and as heavy as can
be procured, but without being coarse or “tarry,” and
the Assam as pungent as can be obtained at the
time.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>SOME ENGLISH BLENDS.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Blended teas are the rule in England, where the skillful
mixing of tea has become an art, very little, if any
tea being sold to consumers that is not mixed or blended
in some manner, every dealer, both wholesale and retail
being identified with or noted for some particular flavored
tea. Many of the blends sold in London, although
differing widely in character, are most skilfully and
scientifically combined, the greatest care being taken that
no tea is introduced which might act detrimentally upon
any other tea in the blend. The majority of these blends
are markedly distinct, almost opposite, the chief features
of one being a rough, strong, but ripe Saryune Congou,
that of another being an even-leafed, delicate-flavored
Chingwo, the base of a third being a plain Ningchow or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>fruity Oonfa, to which is added an Assam Pekoe or Souchong
to increase its thickness and pungency as well as
give tone to the mixture, together with a small quantity
of low-priced <a id='tn189'></a>Kaisow to reduce its cost. But however
great the divergence in the blends, whenever knowledge
and judgment have been brought to bear on the subject
success has followed in its wake, and although the most
of the combinations are exceedingly popular there is still
ample room for the introduction of others as well as for
improvements upon those that are at present in use.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>14.</span></b> The following is a very popular London blend,
and will be duly appreciated among English residents
generally: 3 pounds Kaisow Congou, 2 pounds Souchong,
2 pounds Assam, 1 pound Pekoe and 1 pound
Foochow Oolong. The foundation of this combination
as will be observed, is composed of China Congous, the
Souchong enriching, the Assam giving sharpness and
pungency, the Oolong softening and mellowing and the
Pekoe imparting aroma and piquancy to the entire.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>15.</span></b> Another English blend, cheaper, and consequently
not as satisfactory, is composed as follows:
6 pounds Ningchow, 6 pounds Oonfa and 5 pounds Cachar
or Darjeeling Congous, 5 pounds Oolong, 1 pound
Caper and 1 pound Pekoe. The Congous forming
the base of this blend being lacking in strength, an
extra quantity of Cachar is required to “bring them
up,” while the equal quantity of Oolong softens and the
Scented teas give a tone to the high-toasty flavor of
the India.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Blending teas scoops or guessing should not be
relied on, but scales and weights always used in measuring.
If it is worth the time and trouble to test a number of
teas so that the most suitable may be selected, it certainly
must be worth a little more of each to weigh and arrange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the proportions in the best and most advantageous manner,
and not risk the success of the combination by a
rough conjecture at the various quantities composing it.
The advantage of correctly weighing tea for blending is
not surpassed by that of selecting it in the first place,
and a blend should never, under any circumstances, have
its cost reduced by the introduction of a tea coarser or
rougher in leaf than that of the majority of the kinds
composing the mixture. Low-priced teas when used for
this purpose should be clean, plain and sweet, as a tea of
more pronounced character will stamp its own impression
on the other teas instead of its being lost among
them, its coarse features standing out prominently, while
the superior qualities of the finer grades will be, if not
entirely obliterated, so marred as to be unrecognizable.
Whereas, if the blend is so arranged that the most powerful
tea is also the highest grade in it, the effect is that
all the other teas are elevated to its level. Teas should
on no account be ever blended in wet or damp weather,
as they have a natural susceptibility for absorbing moisture
and all surrounding odors. After blending, they
should be immediately replaced in the original lead-lined
package and covered, or in tightly-covered cans, to
exclude the air and protect them from the weather, and
then allowed to stand from a week to ten days in order
to let them assimilate and unite their opposite qualities.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VARIOUS METHODS OF PREPARING FOR USE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In China, where tea has been in use from time immemorial,
and where it not only forms the regular
beverage of the people but also administers to the
luxury of the epicure, it is generally prepared in the
cup. The tea service consists of large porcelain cups
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>which fit into a silver base, a smaller cup and cover,
the leaves being placed in the large cup which is filled
with boiling water and also covered. In about two
minutes when the tea is drawn it is decanted from the
large to the smaller cups, the cover being used to strain
off the tea, after which it is drank without the addition
of either sugar or milk. Another shorter method is to
first put a small quantity of leaves in a cup and place
a perforated silver-lid on top to keep them down, <i>briskly</i>
boiling water is then poured on and the cups covered
with a saucer to prevent the aroma from escaping. The
tea is then allowed to brew or “draw” in this manner
from eight to ten minutes, after which the infusion is
drank from the original cup. By these simple processes
only the more volatile and stimulating properties of the
leaves are extracted the tannin or astringent principle
being retained in the leaves and an immeasurably much
finer beverage produced than by any other known method.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Mandarins and wealthier Chinese prepare it in a
small hollow ball made of either gold or silver, about the
size of a walnut, suspended from a finger-ring by a
slender chain of the same material four to five inches
long. This “tea-ball” is divided in the middle, the
halves being hinged and perforated with innumerable
holes, but is often made like a globular sieve of gold or
silver wire connected in the same manner. The halves
are filled with tea-leaves and then clasped tight and suspended
by the ring and chain from one of the fingers of
the right hand into a porcelain cup of freshly boiling
water and gently moved to and fro or up and down until
the water is colored to the desired height, the strength
of the infusion thus prepared depending much on the
length of time the tea-ball is agitated in the cup, making
it strong or weak as may be required. The Chinese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>invariably make the infusion with rain or spring water
heated to a high degree, the ebullition lasting only a few
minutes and poured on the leaves just as soon as the
bubbles appear on top of the water.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>The Japanese, to whom tea is as valuable as it is to
the Chinese, first reduce the leaves to a fine powder by
grinding them in a small hand-mill made for the purpose,
and then mix it with hot water to the consistency of a
thin pulp, in which form it is sipped, not drank, particularly
by the aristocracy and richer people, being made
and served to visitors in the following manner: The tea-table,
with the powdered tea enclosed in a box, is set
before the company and the cups filled with boiling water
as much of the powder as would cover the point of a
knife put into each cup, which is then stirred and mixed
with a curious denticulated instrument until the liquor
foams, in which state it is served to the company, and
sipped while warm. Customarily they strain the liquid
before drinking, but frequently the tea and pulverized
leaves are drank together in the same manner that the
Turks and other Orientals use coffee.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>In Cashmere a beverage called “Cha Tulch” is prepared
from tea by boiling the leaves in a tin-lined copper
pot to a strong, dark decoction, and while boiling briskly
<i>phule</i> (red potash), anise-seed and a little salt is added,
after which it is poured into a kettle and finally served
in porcelain tea-cups. It is also prepared there in a
vessel termed a <i>Chajos</i>—kettle and tea-pot combined—and
poured direct into the cups, but is used only after
meals, more particularly after the morning repast. The
morning meal, consisting of this decoction and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>plain biscuit served hot. Another preparation, known as
“churned tea,” made in a similar manner, but afterwards
regularly churned like milk, is highly prized among them,
being used exclusively for entertaining visitors. And there
is no doubt that the Cashmere ladies talk scandal, vent
their grievances and discuss their bonnets and their
babies over this peculiar beverage in the same manner as
do their more civilized sisters in America at their “five
o’clock teas.”</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>Vumah cha or “Cream tea” is the favorite form in
Turkestan in the preparation of which only Black tea is
used, but is a much stronger decoction than that ordinarily
made. The leaves are boiled in a copper pot and
the color heightened by lifting spoonfuls up and letting
them fall back again into the vessel while boiling, cream
being added to it meantime and bread soaked in it, after
which it is eaten. Another preparation termed Seen cha
or “bitter tea” is made from Green tea infused in the
regular way, but drawn for a shorter time, as the lighter
the color the higher it is valued.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>The Persians boil the leaves in a pot or kettle until the
water assumes a blackish color and bitter taste, after
which they add fennel, anise-seed, cloves and sugar to it,
while the Hindoos and Cingalese simply put the leaves
in seething water and use the liquor only without the
addition of any other ingredient. In Chinese-Tartary
tea is prepared in the customary manner as with us, but
the liquor and leaves are swallowed together. The Mongols
generally add milk, but make a much stronger decoction
and use only the infusion, while the Bokharis use
only Black tea mixed with camel’s milk or suet, breaking
up their bread in it, always carrying a bag of it with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>them when traveling, giving it to their innkeepers to brew
as they need it.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>In Siam when the water is well boiled they pour it on
the leaves which have been put in an earthen pot proportional
to the quantity they intend to make, the ordinary
amount being as much as they can take up with the
finger and thumb to a pint of water. They cover the
pot until the leaves have sunk to the bottom and then
serve it up in china dishes to be drank as hot as can be
endured without sugar or milk.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>A preparation called <i>Shamma</i> or “residue” is made
from the spent or exhausted leaves—that is, leaves once
used—in Beloochistan, and chewed like the pan or betel-leaf
is in India and the coca in South America, and is
claimed to have the same exhilarating effect in enabling
them to stand fatigue and long journeys.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>Tea is prepared for use in Thibet by first grinding the
leaves and mixing them with bullock’s blood. This
compound is then pressed into the form of bricks, dried
by a fire-heat and wrapped in sheepskin until required
for use, in which form it also serves as a currency throughout
Central Asia. A kind of “bouillon” or soup is made
from them by boiling in water and adding salt flour,
oil, tallow or camel’s milk.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>Among the Arabs tea is prepared by first placing a
large kettle over a wood fire to heat and then filling it
with water, the leaves being meantime mixed with salt and
thrown into the water as it heats. When it approaches
the boiling point they are rapidly stewed and lifted with
a large ladle until the liquid becomes dark brown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>when it is poured into another vessel, the kettle being
cleaned meanwhile and a paste composed of meal and
butter put in to fry in it. The tea infusion with cream
added is then poured on the whole, ladled as before,
after which the mass is removed and set aside to cool.
In this condition it is ladled into wooden mugs and
served up, the decoction thus prepared forming both
meat and drink, satisfying hunger and thirst at the same
time.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>Tea in Morocco is regarded as a “course meal” the
tea-pot or kettle is first filled with Green tea, sugar and
water in such proportion as to make a thick syrup, which
is used without the addition of milk or cream, but
frequently add <a id='tn195'></a>spearmint, wormwood, verbena, citron,
and on great occasions ambergris. It is usually drank
while seated cross-legged on soft carpets, spread on
the floor around a costly tray with small feet raising
it a few inches from the floor, furnished with glasses in
place of cups, nothing else being taken at the meal. An
infusion made of tea and tansy is also a favorite beverage
with the people of Morocco which is highly aromatic
and tonic in its effect, and claimed by them to be a
remedy for debility.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>In Switzerland it is customary to mix cinnamon with
the leaves before making the infusion, and brew both
together at the same time in the usual manner. While
in France and other continental countries brandy, wine,
or other liquor is generally added to the beverage
before drinking.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'>The Russians, who are a nation of tea-drinkers, and
who are close enough to the Chinese to have received
some knowledge of their methods of preparing tea for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>use, are very particular in using fresh-boiled water. They
prepare it in the same manner as with us, sliced lemon
being invariably added to the infusion before using,
which wonderfully improves the flavor, making a delicious
beverage. Sugar or milk are seldom added, but in
cold weather a kind of liquor called “Vodki” is substituted
for the lemon, the latter making it a potent drink,
sending a glow all over the body. The vessels used by
Russians in making tea consists of a small china tea-pot
and a “Samovar” invariably, but the tea is not brewed
or “drawn” in this vessel as is generally supposed, it
being simply the utensil in which the water is boiled,
taking the place and serving the same purpose as our
tea-kettle. It is usually of brass, though often of other
metal, urn-like in shape, but, unlike an ordinary urn,
having an inner compartment or cylinder running through
the middle, in which is placed burning charcoal for heating
the water to an extreme temperature on the principle of
a tubular boiler. The charcoal is not lighted until the
Samovar is placed on the table, the water being drawn
on to the tea as required, the tea being first put in a
porcelain or earthenware tea-pot and filled from the
Samovar; the first water is poured off the tea as soon as
it is put on, being used merely to carry off the dust. A
second water is then used for drawing the tea, sufficient
to make a strong infusion, being poured on at once, after
which the tea-pot is covered, an ample “cosy” being
fitted over it to keep the tea warm and prevent the aroma
from escaping, and is then allowed to draw from four to
five minutes. Sufficient of this beverage is poured into
each cup or <i>glass</i> and a slice of lemon added, as tea is
drank chiefly from glasses set in metal frames in Russia,
and the glass refilled with boiling water from the
Samovar.</p>

<hr class='c022'>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>It is strange that nothing is ever done in this country
by dealers to attempt to educate or enlighten their customers
how to properly prepare their tea, study the
water or preserve its aromatic properties after purchasing,
seeing, as they must, how little the art is understood in
this country particularly. Good tea can be kept intact,
like good wine, for years with considerable advantage to
both dealer and consumer alike, and there is no valid
reason why consumers of tea should not be as particular
and fastidious as buyers of wine. But to obtain good tea
in the first place the consumer should purchase only the
best, it requiring much less of the finer grades to make
a good infusion—purchasing only from the most reputable
dealers, those who know or study to understand their
business. As a nation, the American people want the
best of everything, or, as they characteristically express
it, “the best is good enough for them,” and they intend
to have it if money can purchase it. But of what avail
is the best—tea for instance—if it be not prepared properly
or in such a manner as to develop and secure its
more delicate, subtle, volatile, refreshing and exhilarating
properties. A country that expends annually upwards
of sixteen millions of dollars on this commodity alone
ought to devote a little more time and trouble in studying
the best methods of preparing it and in extracting its
most desirable and fragrant qualities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea may be made depressing and injurious, or exhilarating
and wholesome, according to the manner in which
it is treated and prepared for use. Many who imagine
that a high, dark-colored liquor indicates strength, boil
the leaves, while others, again, spoil the tea by putting
the leaves into the boiling water, some people putting the
leaves in cold water and then placing the vessel over
the fire to boil, prolonged infusion being still another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>serious mistake. All of these methods produce the
same evil results—that of extracting an increased amount
of the tannic acid—thereby destroying the flavor of the
tea by giving it a bitter and astringent taste as well as
imparting an almost ink-black color to the infusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The falsely economical custom of filling the tea-pot a
second time without removing the exhausted leaves is
another error in the making of tea, as the theine which is
only soluble in fresh-boiled water, is wholly extracted in
the first drawing and cannot for this reason be present in
the second, the latter being merely a decoction composed
chiefly of tannin. To avoid this error a sufficient
quantity of tea should be made in the first drawing or
fresh leaves supplied as needed. And still another
reprehensible practice is that of adding fresh leaves to
those that have already been used once, it being utterly
impossible to add either to the strength or flavor of tea
by putting more leaves in the tea-pot after the first
drawing, for the reason that <i>tea-water</i> will not extract
the active principle—theine—from the dry leaves of fresh
tea; <i>only fresh boiling water will do this</i>. The use of
tea-water simply increases the amount of tannin, darkens
the color, destroys the flavor and only adds to the
quantity of leaves already in the pot without in the least
affecting the active principle, so that if it be necessary
to increase the strength of the tea prepared, draw some
fresh leaves in a separate vessel and add the liquor to
that already made.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea being an <i>infusion</i>, not a <i>decoction</i>, it should be
<i>brewed</i>, not <i>stewed</i>, the object being to extract as much
of the <i>theine</i> or refreshing principle and as little of the
<i>tannin</i> or astringent property as possible, without, at the
same time, either boiling or overdrawing. So that in
the proper preparation of tea for use, the aim and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>object should be to extract as little of the <i>tannin</i> as
possible and as much of the <i>theine</i> and <i>volatile</i> oil as can be
conveniently extracted without permitting the infusion
to boil, to obtain which most desirable result the following
general rules are recommended: Put the requisite
quantity of leaves in a covered china or earthenware
vessel—avoid tin or metal of any kind, even silver—then
pour on fresh, <i>briskly</i>-boiling water and let stand where it
will keep <i>hot</i> without boiling from seven to ten minutes
according to the variety of tea used. In this time, while
the tea is <i>drawing</i>, only the refreshing and stimulating
principles (theine and volatile) are extracted from the
leaves. Boiling or prolonged infusion dissolves and
brings out the astringent principle (tannin) which injures
the nerves and impairs digestion, for which reason no tea
that has been either boiled or overdrawn is fit to drink.
When tea has been boiled or overdrawn it can be readily
detected by the exceedingly dark color of the liquor, as
well as by its bitter and astringent flavor.</p>

<p class='c009'>To insure a really good “cup of tea” the kettle must be
filled with <i>fresh</i> water—if distilled the better—and boiled
for about three minutes; there will be a sparkle about tea
made with fresh-boiled water that it cannot receive from
flat, hot water, which has been boiled long or repeatedly.
For moderate strength it requires one heaping teaspoonful
of good tea to each half-pint of boiling water or an
ordinary tea-cup half-full to a quart of water will make a
sufficiently strong infusion for five persons. No metal
vessel, not even one of silver, is fit to make tea in, nothing
being better adapted for the purpose than the old-fashioned
tea-pot of heavy, glazed, brown earthenware,
covered with a tea-cosy—a tufted cushion, cap-shaped,
which envelopes the tea-pot, keeping the tea warm and
the aroma from escaping<a id='tn199'></a>. This vessel must be first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“scalded” and set on the range to dry and keep hot,
after which the tea is put in and allowed to heat for a few
minutes before the boiling water is poured on the leaves,
and the infusion allowed to draw or “brew” from five
to ten minutes according to the variety of tea under
treatment.</p>

<p class='c009'>India and Ceylon teas are usually “drawn” in five minutes,
longer infusion, owing to their great excess of tannin,
making them still more bitter and astringent than
they naturally are under ordinary conditions. The addition
of extra quantities of milk and sugar, however,
greatly modifies their great strength, sharp pungency
and pronounced flavor. China Green and Japan teas require
from six to eight minutes to “draw” thoroughly,
while China Oolongs are best at from eight to ten.
China Congous yielding lower percentages of tannin
than most other varieties, the time allowed should be
longer than ten minutes if a full yield of their best properties
should be desired. They will also be found more
suitable to temperaments to which teas containing larger
quantities of tannin are found injurious or objectionable.
China teas in general do not require much milk or
sugar, while Japans are more pleasing and palatable
without the addition of either.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything should be clean, the water fresh and the
tea drawn at a specific heat, to insure which requires a
brisk fire or gas heat, and different treatment according
to the season of the year. Care should be taken that
the water boils, it being much better to let it boil for a
few minutes than use it under the boiling point. In
winter the vessel should be made hot and the leaves
heated in it before the water is poured on, for about a
minute, while in summer the tea-pot need not be heated
or the water poured on while boiling, but should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>allowed to cease for a few seconds, more or less, according
to the heat of the day. It is also a needless operation
to pour a small quantity of water on the tea for
a preliminary drawing, as is frequently done. Always fill
the tea-pot, or pour in at once the quantity required, but
for the more temperate seasons a modification of these
methods may be adopted. The longest time that any
tea should be allowed to steep is from five to ten minutes.
As soon as it has been steeped this length of time, at the
outside, it should be served. Even if it is allowed to
remain on the stove a few minutes after this time it will
be ruined.</p>

<p class='c009'>The character of the water used greatly influences the
liquor and flavor of the tea. Soft water should always
be used when available, it being next to impossible to
make good tea with hard water. Excess of lime in the
water also deteriorates the infusion, the last difficulty
may, however, be remedied by the judicious use of carbonate
of soda, as much as would cover the face of a
dime being sufficient for an ordinary drawing of tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea being an extremely delicate and sensitive article,
it should be protected from all foul and foreign flavors,
its susceptibility to the odors of other articles being a
source of danger and deterioration, as it readily absorbs
the smell of coffee, cocoa, spices, meats, fish and other
commodities of pronounced flavor. Even when securely
packed in the lead-lined chests in which it is received
from the producing countries, the change from the glowing
heat of Eastern skies to our atmosphere deprives it
of much of its pleasing fragrance. For this reason the
complaints so frequently made would not arise if always
kept in places free from contagion or stored in a dry,
warm temperature and not exposed to atmospheric
influences.</p>

  <h4 class='c014'>BEVERAGES PREPARED FROM TEA.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Iced Tea</span></b>—Put the requisite quantity of leaves in an
earthen vessel and pour on briskly boiling water until
the vessel is nearly full, and let it infuse or draw from
two to three minutes; in no case permit it to boil, as boiling
or long infusion extracts the tannin and imparts to
it, even the best tea, a disagreeable, herby or astringent
taste. When infusion is complete, strain the liquor out
of the tea-pot into a jar, demijohn or other covered
receptacle, and place it in a cool place for a few hours,
or until wanted, then serve in a cup or goblet, adding
some cracked ice and a slice or two of lemon. A fine
grade of Chinese Congou or Souchong is best adapted
for this purpose. Choice Oolong is also good, but Japan
tea should never be used, as it is not pleasing when iced
to a well-regulated palate. Fine Imperials and Young
Hysons are also excellent for those whose nerves can
stand Green tea, the first two, however, are best of all,
having an especially agreeable flavor when iced. Plenty
of ice is needed, which should be <i>cracked</i>, not <i>crushed</i>,
and the lemon cut in quarters, the juice being squeezed
out and the pulp scraped into the tea. The rind should
never be used, as the oil contained in it imparts to the
beverage a bitterish taste; use neither milk or sugar
unless you are compelled to from habit. It is the bitter
flavors of the tea and lemon together that is required to
allay the parched feeling of the palate and throat.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Extract of Tea</span></b>—In hot weather an infusion of tea-leaves
made in cold water is much superior to that made
in hot or boiling, for the reason that the aroma will not
be dissipated. An extract made in this manner may be
bottled, and if placed in a moderate temperature will keep
for any reasonable time until required for use. When
serving, fill the glass with cracked ice, put some sugar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>on top of it, add a slice or two of lemon and then pour
on the extract thus made; the result will be a nectar fit
for the gods.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Essence of Tea</span></b>—Is produced from the leaves by
distillation in the form of a dark-colored fluid, of which
one or two spoonfuls added to boiling water will make an
excellent cup of tea in a very short time. When prepared
in a tea-pot, the water should be put in first and
the requisite quantity of essence added afterwards; the
flavor will be pronounced, coming out remarkably well
in the liquor. This essence, when pure and properly
made, will keep for any length of time in any climate on
land or sea.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>New Beverages</span></b>—An effervescent wine may be produced
from tea by forcing carbonic acid gas into the plain
liquor as ordinarily prepared, and another beverage is
produced by the introduction of an effervescing wine to
the liquor only. While a pleasing drink is also prepared
by treating the ordinary infusion with a little yeast and
sugar, a tea-wine being produced from it differing in
color and flavor according to the proportions in which
the constituents are combined. Still another being
evolved from this by the addition of a little alcohol to
the compound. A drink called Rohrer or “tea spirit”
is again produced by adding either whisky or brandy to
the plain infusion when fresh made.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Paraguayan Tea</span></b>—Is prepared in a filter or perforated
bowl, known as a Maté, heated with warm water.
A thin layer of sugar is first put in and a layer of leaves
laid on top, another layer of sugar being added, the
leaves being sandwiched between. The vessel is next
filled with boiling water, which is allowed to percolate
through the leaves and sugar. Before serving it is again
sweetened with sugar until it becomes almost syrupy in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>substance, and frequently flavored with cinnamon, orange
or lemon juice. Goat’s milk is often used instead of
water, when thus prepared the infusion becomes ambrosial,
approaching to that of “Chocolate Italienne” or nectar
in flavor, becoming still more palatable when cold, but if
allowed to stand too long exposed to the influence of the
atmosphere it gets muddy and sours quickly.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_4 c008'>Tea in chemistry is a complex mixture of a variety
of substances, including <i>Theine</i>, <i>Tannin</i>, <i>Dextrine</i>,
<i>Glucose</i>, <i>Gum</i> and an essential oil known as
<i>Volatile</i>, which, together with a portion of the ash, pass
into the solution when tea is infused. Being a leaf it
also contains some woody fibre, the quantity of which as
determined by Mulder, ranges from 17.1 in Green to
28.3 per cent. in Black teas. According to Peligot,
whose admirable investigation of tea ranks as a chemical
classic, it also contains a large quantity of legumen, a
nitrogenous substance, sometimes termed vegetable
<i>Caseine</i>, the percentage of which, as given by Peligot, is
about 15 per cent. in tea in its usual commercial state.
The woody fibre, legumen, some tannin <i>coloring-matter</i>
and a certain quantity of the ash make up mainly the
portion of the leaf which is not soluble in boiling
water. In its commercial state tea is not subject to
much irregularity in a hygrometric condition, there
being only about 8 per cent. of moisture in it, which
may fall to 6 or rise to 10 per cent. from outside causes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea has been analyzed by many other chemists, but

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Theine</span></b>—Is the alkaloid of tea and is the substance
to which it owes its refreshing and stimulating properties.
It is a crystallizable matter, soluble in water, very
bitter to the taste and characteristic alike of both tea and
coffee, being to these beverages what quinine is to bark,
and with the base of cocoa which has recently received
the name of “theobromine,” it is also closely related. It
is further remarkable as occurring in many other plants
dissimilar in structure and character, grown in remote
countries, but yet selected by the inhabitants on account
of their yielding a slightly exciting and refreshing beverage,
and to the presence of which the peculiar physiological
action of tea on the animal economy is attributed.
It was first discovered under the name of <i>Caffeine</i> by
Runge, who originally found it in Coffee, and later by
Oudry, who extracted an identical substance from tea, to
which he gave the name of <i>Theine</i>. Strickler subsequently
produced it from cocoa, naming it <i>Theobromine</i>.
These bodies are evidently related to uric acid as like it,
when exposed to the action of nitric acid and ammonia
they yield a purple coloring matter, technically termed
murioxide.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Theine is a substance which crystallizes very beautifully,
forming white, silk-like crystals containing an atom
of water of crystallization, the specific gravity of which
is 1.23 at 1°C., and the 9 water of crystallization is not
altogether evaporated by a temperature of 150°. As
deposited from aqueous solutions it still contains an atom
of water, but as deposited from solutions in alcohol
or ether, or when sublimed it is anhydrous. It is
much more soluble in hot than cold water or in
alcohol or ether, and according to Peligot, one part of
theine dissolves in 300 parts ether or in 93 parts water at
ordinary temperatures. It is a base of the same class as
aniline and urea, that is to say, it will combine with
acids yielding crystalline compounds, but never neutralizing
an acid. With chloride of platinum, chloride of
gold and corrosive sublimate, the hydrochlorate of theine
enters into combination, forming a double salt with each.
As will be manifest from its formula—<a id='tn207'></a>C<sub>8</sub>—H<sub>10</sub>—N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>—theine
is one of the most highly nitrogenous substances
known to chemists, and connected with this high percentage
of nitrogen (almost double that formed in any other
albuminous substance) is its property of yielding an
abundance of cyanides when fused with soda lime,
which property distinguishes it from a number of organic
bases, such as piperine, morphine, quinine and cinchonine.
With the base of cocoa—which has received
the name of theobromine—theine is also closely related,
being nothing more than methylated theobromine.
Strecker having produced it from theobromine by acting
upon a silver derivative with iodide of methyl, in a
sealed tube heated at 100°. Theine exists in tea,
not in the free state, but in the form of tannate of
tea, which appears to be dissolved by the excess of
tannic acid contained by the tea leaf, and so it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>happens that the theine makes its appearance in the
infusion instead of remaining in the exhausted leaves.
The proportion of theine in tea has been variously
given by different chemists. Mulder finding 0.43 per
cent. in Green tea and 0.46 in Black, while Stenhouse
found 1.05 and 1.27 in Green and Black respectively.
Peligot found 2.34 and 3.0, and Zoller, whose research is
comparatively recent, found 3.94 per cent. of theine in
India tea. But it would be a mistake to regard these
varying results as showing that the quantity of theine
in tea is variable, as they serve only to illustrate the difficulties
which stand in the way of a <a id='tn208'></a>quantitative extraction
of the theine, and the imperfection of the earlier methods.
In Peligot’s paper, these difficulties are referred to, and by
making an attempt to extract the theine from a sample
of tea the chemist acquires a sense of the truth of them.
The experiments of the latter, however, being of great
interest to chemists merits a somewhat detailed description.
He began by determining the total amount of
nitrogen contained in the dried leaves of different kinds
of China tea at 110°, finding 6.15 per cent. in 100 parts
of Oolong, 6.58 in Congou, and 6.30 in Green tea, while
from one sample of India he extracted only 5.10 per cent.,
proportions six times greater than had been heretofore
obtained by any previous analysis. Next testing every
soluble substance for nitrogenous matter, he proceeded
by successive eliminations to ascertain the quantity of
theine in 27 other different samples and found that Green
teas contained on an average 10 per cent. of water, and
Black only 8 per cent., and also that the latter contained
about 43.2 of matter soluble in boiling water while the
former averaged as high as 47.1, and that this soluble
matter yielded only 4.35 of nitrogen in Black teas, and
4.70 per cent. in Green. It remaining to be determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>whether this large percentage of nitrogen was wholly
due to the theine or in part to some other principle, he
next found that the precipitate with sub-acetate of lead
contained no apparent quantity, and then testing the
theine by a modification of Mulder’s process obtained
from Green tea an average of 2.48 per cent., and from a
mixture of Green and Black 2.70. But greatly as these
quantities exceed those of all other chemists, they were
still unable to account for the whole amount of nitrogen
found in the infusion, so by adding mere acetate of lead
and ammonia, separating them by filtration, and passing
through it a current of sulphuretted hydrogen to precipitate
the lead, and evaporating the liquid with a gentle
heat he obtained an abundant supply of crystals of theine.
This supply he still further increased by re-evaporation
until the whole amounted to 3.48 per cent. of the entire.
There still remaining a syrup containing some theine it
was precipitated with tannic acid, the result being added
to that already crystallized it yielded a total of 5.84 from
Green tea in the natural state and 6.21 in the dried
leaf. These experiments being further continued by
boiling the exhausted leaves with potash, it showed a
presence of caseine to the extent of 28 per cent. of the
mass, the proportion of the latter substance in the raw
leaf being only 14 to 15.</p>

<p class='c009'>Theine is extracted from tea by boiling a quantity of
the leaves in a considerably larger quantity of distilled
water and the liquor squeezed out of the leaves which are
to be boiled with a fresh quantity of water and again
subjected to pressure, the process being repeated a third
time. The several portions of the infusion expressed
from the leaves are put in the same vessel, mixed together
thoroughly and treated with an excess of acetate of lead
and ammonia, which precipitates the tannin and coloring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>matter. The liquor is next filtered and the filtrate evaporated
down to a small bulk, first over a naked flame and
afterwards in a water bath, and on being allowed to cool
the solution will deposit crude theine which is removed
by filtration, and the filtration nearly dried up in the water
bath, and the residue boiled with alcohol, which dissolves
the theine out of it. From this hot alcoholic solution
theine crystallizes on cooling, a final purification being
effected by crystallization from ether and decolorizing with
animal charcoal. A simpler but less effective method
is to place the dust of finely powdered tea-leaves, or an
evaporated watery extract on a watch glass and cover it
with a paper cone and hold it over a spirit lamp or gas jet
the vapor arising from the glass condenses on the interior
of the cone and forms small crystals of theine. Concentrated
sulphuric acid dissolves theine in the cold
without the production of color, but if the alkaloid be
treated with nitric acid evaporated to dryness, and the
reddish-yellow residue moistened with a little ammonia it
turns a splendid purple color. Again, if a solution of
theine be evaporated with chlorine on a watch glass a
reddish-brown residue is obtained, which if again treated
with the vapor of ammonia it becomes a deep violet of
which the chief precipitants will be phosphoric acid, iodine
and platinum, forming a yellow and brown precipitate
respectively.</p>

<p class='c009'>Theine having no odor and only a slightly bitter
taste it obviously has very little to do with the
flavor of tea. It is, however, considered a very valuable
constituent on account of the large percentage of nitrogen
which it contains and to which is attributed the peculiar
physiological action of tea on the animal economy, but
what changes it undergoes in the human system has not
yet been determined. When oxydized artificially it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>decomposes into methleamic (hydrocyanic<a id='tn211b'></a>) acid, a nitrogenous
compound closely allied to caseine or gluten,
and as hot water extracts but very little of this substance
a large amount of it is wasted in the ordinary infusion,
which might otherwise be saved by the addition of a little
carbonate of soda to the water in preparing it.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Tannin<a id='tn211a'></a></span></b>—A large portion of the Tea-extract consists
of tannin (tannic acid of a peculiar kind), there being
much more in Green teas than in Black, ranging from 13
to 20 per cent. in the former, and 8 to 12 per cent.
in the latter, but averaging 12 and 9.50 per cent. respectively,
the difference being due to the fact that part
of the tannin originally existing in the raw-leaf is
destroyed during the process of fermentation to which
Black teas are subjected in manipulation. It is a powerful
astringent principle, puckering up the mouth when
chewed, and to which tea owes its bitterness when overdrawn
or boiled, constipating effect on the bowels, and
the inky-black color which it imparts to water containing
salts-of-iron. But whether it contributes in any degree
to the exhilarating, satisfying or narcotic action of the tea
has not yet been determined. Johnston thinks it probable
that it does exert some such effect from the fact that a
species of tannin is found in the Betel-nut, which when
chewed produces a mild form of intoxication, but as to
whether this property assists or retards digestion is
still an unsettled question, the old maxim, “what is
one man’s meat is another man’s poison,” being particularly
true of this substance. Many persons finding
that the use of tea while eating, or immediately after
eating, has a soothing effect on their system, while
the same persons after drinking coffee, under like
circumstances, get nervous, and cannot digest their food
properly. As there is no tannin in coffee, it stands to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>reason that the substance must have some influence on
the digestive organs.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the estimation of tannin in tea various processes
are in use, a tritration by means of a standard solution
of gelatine, which depends upon the well-known property
possessed by gelatine of forming insoluble compounds
with tannin being the most effective, but tedious and
difficult. A much more simple and promising method
consists in tritrating by means of a standard solution of
lead, the point of saturation being indicated by the red
color struck by an ammoniacal solution of ferricyanide
of potassium, one drop of this solution being capable of
coloring one milligram of tannin dissolved in 100 parts
of water, the exact strength of the solution of lead being
ascertained with a standard solution of tannin. In using
the solution of lead, 10 drops of it are first diluted with
9 times its volume in water, and the tea infusion dropped
into it from a graduated burette until the indicator strikes
a red with the drop of the indicator. The infusion of
tea is made by boiling 2 grains of the leaves in water and
afterwards diluting it to 250, it being understood that the
smaller the quantity of this infusion required to saturate
the 10 parts of the lead solution, the higher the percentage
of tannin in the sample of tea treated. This test is
specially applicable for ascertaining whether Black tea in
particular has been mixed with spent leaves. By taking
the normal percentage of tannin in pure Black tea at 10
and the percentage of tannin in spent tea as 2, the difference
is the extent of adulteration.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a great variability in the amount of tannin
contained in the different varieties of tea, varying in
quantity according to the country of production, kind,
quality, and state of growth when picked. In six samples
of China Oolong teas recently tested, the percentage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>of tannin extracted, after an infusion of thirty minutes,
averaged only 7.44, an almost similar result being obtained
from an examination of the finest Congou-China
Green teas, ranging from 11.87 to 14.11 per cent., some
Japan samples under the same conditions yielding on an
average from 8 to 10. While with a sample of the finest
Assam (India) a percentage of 17.73 of tannin by actual
weight was extracted after an infusion of only fifteen minutes,
two samples of India and Ceylon giving respectively
18.91 and 15.26, proving conclusively that India and
Ceylon teas are much more heavily weighted with tannin
than China and Japan teas. The percentage of tannin in
the extract is also quite irregular, according to the quality
of the tea, the ratio of tannin to the extract varying quite
uniformly with the value of the tea, the percentage falling
and rising with the percentage of the extract and cost of
the tea.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Volatile Oil</span></b>—Is the principle which imparts to tea its
peculiar flavor and aroma, and upon the amount contained
in the dried leaves depends the strength and pungency of
the infusion. It is present only in very small quantities,
but is, nevertheless, very potent in its effects, the proportions
ranging, according to Mulder, from 0.6 per cent. in
Black tea to 0.80 in Green, but averaging 0.75 in all good
teas. It is found by distilling the tea with water, is
lighter in body than water, citron-yellow in color, resinifying
on exposure, solidifying with cold, and exerting a
powerfully exciting or stimulating effect on the system.
But there being no chemical analysis of this constituent
extant, its exact effect on the human system is difficult to
define. By some authorities it is claimed to produce
wakefulness, acting, it is said, in the same manner as
<i>digitalis</i> (fox-glove) which, when taken in overdoses,
causes anxiety and inability to sleep. It is a well-known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>fact that Green teas produce these effects, while Black
does not, the excessive fermentation to which the latter
are subjected in the process of curing, dissipating the volatile
oil to a greater extent, or, more properly, altering its
general character not only in effect but also in flavor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b><span class='large'>Gum or Gluten</span></b>—If it is necessary to estimate the
quantity of gum or gluten in tea, as sometimes happens,
evaporate an aqueous decoction of the leaves to an
extract, and treat the residue with methylated spirit, filter
and wash off with hot water, after which evaporate the
solution to dryness, next weighing and burning it to an ash
and deduct the mineral residue from the original weight
of the leaves. Tea extract also yields a large quantity
of ammonia when boiled with potash, and it is probable
that this character may prove valuable also in testing the
genuineness of tea. Tea leaves under an extraordinary
amount of ammonia, when submitted to this test, are
found to be remarkably rich in nitrogen, the determination
of which is also a means of identification. It may
also be here remarked that when tea-leaves have been
exhausted by infusion, alcohol is still capable of extracting
a considerable amount of soluble matter. This
alcohol extract, when infused in boiling water, furnishes
a liquor which smells and tastes strongly of tea, which,
were it not for the expense of the solvent and trouble
attending its separation, could no doubt be profitably
employed. A fixed oil composed of equal parts of oleine
and stearine, serving many purposes, medicinal, illuminating
and others, is extracted from the seeds of the tea-plant
in many parts of China and Tartary. The other
substances extracted from the tea-leaf consists principally
of those which, in various proportions, enter into the composition
of all plants and include a modification of constituents
analagous to sugar, fat, salts, starch and water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>The fibre, tannin, legumen coloring matter and a certain
quantity of ash making up mainly the portion of the leaf
insoluble in boiling water.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>MEDICINAL EFFECTS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The virtues of tea as a medicine have been extolled
from the time of its earliest use as a beverage in China.
<a id='tn215'></a>Chin-nung, a celebrated scholar and philosopher, who
existed long before Confucius, and to whom its first discovery
is attributed, is claimed to have said of it: “Tea
is better than wine, for it leadeth not to intoxication; it
is better than water, for it doth not carry disease, neither
doth it act as a poison when the wells contain foul and
rotten matter;” and Lo-yu, another learned Chinese who
lived during the dynasty of Tang, declared that “Tea
tempers the spirits, harmonizes the mind, dispels lassitude,
relieves fatigue, awakens thought, prevents drowsiness,
refreshes the body and clears the perceptive faculties,”
while the Emperor Kieu-lung advised all his subjects to
“Drink this precious liquor at their ease, as it will chase
away the five causes of sorrow. You can taste and feel,
but not describe the calm state of repose produced
by it.” Again, Ten Rhyne, a botanist and chemist to the
Emperor of Japan, in a work published about 1730,
states that “Tea purifies the blood, drives away frightful
dreams, dispels malignant vapors from the brain, mitigates
dizziness, dries up rheum in the eyes, corrects humors,
regulates the liver, modifies the spleen, restrains sleep,
restricts drowsiness, expels lassitude, is good in dropsy,
makes the body lively, cheers the heart and drives away
fear.” But of its sanitary effects after its first introduction
into Europe there was for a long period much
consternation existing, being preposterously praised by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>some writers as an incentive to virtue, and as unjustly
condemned by others as productive of numerous diseases,
more particularly that of causing an increase of nervous
complaints, which it would perhaps be more just to
attribute to the more complicated state of modern social
customs arising from an augmented population and
advance in luxurious living, in connection with the more
frequent infringement of the natural laws, especially that
of turning night into day, and not seldom day into night,
as is the too common practice of the votaries of fashion,
together with the abuse of stimulants, tobacco and other
narcotics.</p>

<p class='c009'>Its assailants, however, were not very distinguished, but
have been quite emphatic in their condemnation. Jonas
Hanway, a man whose follies may well be pardoned for his
virtues, being, perhaps, the most conspicuous of them.
“He looked abroad upon the world, and perceiving that
many things went wrong with it, and others no longer presented
the same attractive appearance, he remembered them
to have had in his youth, he laid to the charge of tea all
the evils and disenchantments that oppressed his spirits.”
“Men,” he says, “seem to have lost their stature and
comeliness and women their beauty, and what Shakespeare
had asserted to the concealment of love in this age is
more frequently occasioned by the use of tea.” The
champions of our “wholesome sage,” who contended
that “it was far superior to the boasted Indian shrub,”
were but a few of the host who attacked tea as “an innovation
pregnant with danger to the health and good
morals of the people.” Others, again, although resolute
for its banishment from the tea-caddy, were yet willing
to accord it a place in the medicine chest. To such
complaints echoes were not wanting, the tea-drinkers, in
a short time, having it all their own way.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Lettson was the first medical writer who attempted to
give the public a reasonable and scientific account of tea,
but even his fears of its abuse ran away with his judgment.
The poet who commends “the cup that cheers,
but not inebriates,” must have been startled if Lettson’s
pamphlet ever fell into his hands, at the assertion “that
the growth of this pernicious custom (drunkenness) is
often owing to the weakness and debility of the system
brought on by the daily habit of drinking tea,” and that
“the trembling hand seeks relief in some cordial in order
to refresh and excite again the enfeebled system, whereby
such persons fall into the habit of intemperance.” Here
assuredly the exception must have been taken for the
rule, that tea may be so abused as to create a craving for
alcoholic stimulants is unquestionable, but that at any
period of its history its abuse has been so general as to
become the main cause of intoxication may be safely
denied. On the contrary, it was for a long time looked
upon as the great means by which intemperance was to
have been banished from society. Again, if there be
any truth in this charge, why is it that the Chinese and
Japanese, who are the greatest and most inveterate tea-consumers
in the world for centuries, using it in season
and out, are yet the most temperate? It is, however,
admitted that the tremblings and other nervous effects
produced by tea on brokers and professional testers,
liquor is too frequently resorted to as an offset, and that
by the practice of some tea drinkers of the absurd and
dangerous Russian and English customs of adding vodki,
gin or other alcoholic stimulant to the “cup of tea,” a
habit is oftentimes acquired which can never afterwards
be relinquished. Neither is it true, as alleged by
Lettson, that the use of tea has been the cause of the
increase of nervous and kindred complaints in colleges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and seminaries. Still, his advice is sound when he
states that “tea ought by no means to be the common
drink of boarding schools, and when allowed, in
moderation, the pupils should at the same time be
informed that the constant or too frequent use of
tea would be injurious to their health and constitutions.
As whatever tends to impair the nerve power
and ultimately the digestive organs, in strumuous
children particularly, should be by all means avoided.”
But if a diminution of the number of inflammatory diseases
be one of the consequences of the increased consumption
of tea, which is now generally conceded, it is very
much in favor of its use, as however distracting nervous
diseases may be, they are by no means so fatal as those
of an inflammatory nature, more particularly as the
former can be almost immediately remedied by relinquishing
the use of tea or by simply omitting it from the
breakfast for a time, at which meal it is certainly less
proper to be used.</p>

<p class='c009'>The medicinal uses of tea, however, are not many,
neither does its chemical analysis shed much light on its
action on the human economy, a correct estimate of its
particular action thereon having so far not been ascertained.
So that before attempting any such estimate it
will be necessary to consider that many of its attributed
ill-effects may be due as much to the spurious leaves of
other plants so frequently mixed with genuine tea-leaves
for adulteration purposes, as well as to the deleterious
compounds so often used in coloring, for the results of
which pure tea is held responsible. The most dispassionate
inquirers, however, regard it as a narcotic, the
stimulating period of which is most conspicuous and
of the longest duration, the active ingredient, theine,
being an alkaloid identical with the caffeine of coffee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>the medical action of the tea infusion upon the system
is the result of the several effects of this alkaloid formed
by combination of the theine, tannin, volatile oil, and the
hot water. Of these elements theine probably plays the
most important part, and like all other potent alkaloids
theine is a powerful modifier of the nerve functions,
increasing the action of the skin and cooling the body
by lessening the force of the circulation, but does not
cause any congestion of the <a id='tn219'></a>mucous membrane, particularly
in that of the bowels. In answer to the question
whether <i>theine</i> produces nervousness and wakefulness,
reliable authorities answer: No! But that, on the contrary,
the effect of theine upon the human system is a
calming and soothing one, producing a sense of repose
and supplying to the body that which is lost by fatigue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The experiments made with tea on a number of
animals for the purpose of ascertaining its effects on the
nervous and muscular apparatus give varying results, the
most important being that of lessening the amount of
nitrogenous excreta, notably that of the urine, which
means to diminish the rate at which nitrogenous substances
are oxydized within the body, such action being
probably due to the volatile oil, as Lehman found the
same oil in roasted coffee to produce the same action in
his experiments. There being a substance in the flesh
or muscles of all animals known as <i>kreatine</i>, the chemical
properties of which are analogous to those of <i>theine</i>,
and it is now generally accepted that these substances
are most agreeable to the human system as food which
most nearly resemble the compound that form the tissues
and muscles of the body, while those act as poison
whose composition is most different from that of the
tissues and muscles on which the life of the body
depends. Scientists who have made this subject a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>special study, inform us that the substance known as
kreatine is diminished by overwork and fatigue, and that,
therefore, as <i>theine</i> and <i>kreatine</i> are chemically about one
and the same property, the theory is accepted that the
theine in tea supplies best that which is lost to the
system by the wear and tear of life, the property termed
<i>caffeine</i> in coffee being identical with both, serving the
same purpose. While Liebig suggests that theine contributes
to the formation of <i>taurine</i>, a compound peculiar
to bile, and Lehman found that its administration is
followed by a slight augmentation of urea. It has also
been proven that <i>theine</i> and <i>quinine</i> are similar in
nature, and that on analysis these substances are shown
to contain the same proportions of carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen and hydrogen, and, as is well known, quinine is
about the only remedy used in intermittent and malarial
fevers and ague. These facts being settled beyond dispute,
it can be readily understood why it is that tea is so
soothing and beneficial to those who may feel feverish,
tired or debilitated. And while it is not claimed that tea
alone will cure fever and ague, it certainly acts as a
preventative.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the early stages of fever it is found very valuable
when given in the form of a cold infusion, it being not
only considered an excellent diluent at the commencement,
but also when administered in the form of “a
tincture,” prepared by macerating the leaves in proof
spirit and adding a teaspoonful of the mixture to a small
cup of water. This preparation is given to the patient
at short intervals during the night, after the acute symptoms
have subsided, and is often of great benefit during
the latter stages. For this purpose, in hospitals and
other institutions, the leaves which have been used once
for the regular infusion, may be macerated in alcohol and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>a tincture of sufficient strength obtained at a cheap and
economical rate. In a peculiar state of the brain,
termed “sthenic excitement,” a condition clearly bordering
on inflammation, more especially when produced by
alcoholic stimulants, intense study or long-continued
application of the mind to any particular subject or
literary research, an infusion made from Green tea will
quickly act as a salutary remedy. While, on the contrary,
in periods of diminished excitement, a morbid
vigilance and increased nervous disturbance is certain
to follow its use, much better results being produced by
small quantities repeated than by large ones in such
cases.</p>

<p class='c009'>In cases of poisoning by arsenic and antimony, fatal
results have been prevented by the prompt administration
of a strong infusion of tea, its power as an antidote in such
cases depending on the tannin decomposing the poisonous
substances. While it is nearly as valuable an antidote to
poisoning by opium as coffee, it is, however, only useful
in combatting the secondary symptoms, and should
never be administered in such cases until the stomach
pump or other means have removed the opium from the
stomach. In some forms of heart disease, tea proves a
useful sedative, while in others it is positively injurious.
Many cases of severe nervous headache are instantly
relieved by a cup of strong Green tea taken without the
addition of either milk or sugar, but should be only
occasionally resorted to in such cases, it being much
better to avoid the cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>The almost total absence of gouty and calculous diseases
in China and Japan is claimed to be attributable to
the constant and inveterate use of tea by the inhabitants
of these countries, in confirmation of which Prout says:
“Persons of a gouty or rheumatic nature, and, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>especially, those prone to calculous diseases, will find tea
the least objectionable article of common drink, but
should use it without the addition of sugar and only
very little milk. When the water is hard, the addition
of a small quantity of carbonate of soda will improve the
flavor of the tea at the same time, rendering it a more
proper beverage for persons so affected, but should not
be taken by them for at least four hours after any solid
meal, the addition of the alkali serving to increase the
action of the skin as well as to augment its cooling and
refreshing properties in the fullest degree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Smith alleges that “tea promotes all vital actions,
the action of the skin particularly being increased and
that of the bowels lessened, the kidney secretions are
also affected, and the urine, perhaps, somewhat diminished,
the latter being uncertain.” Other recent
authorities agreeing that the direct effect of tea upon the
human system is to increase the assimilation of food,
both of the heat-giving and flesh-forming kinds, and that
with an abundance of food it promotes nutrition, while in
the absence of sufficient food it increases the waste of
the tissues and body generally. An infusion of cold tea
has been known to check violent retching and vomiting,
while a very hot one will prove beneficial in severe
attacks of colic and diarrhœa, having a specific action
on the kidneys and urine. An application of infused tea
leaves will subdue inflammation of the eyes produced by
cold or other causes, but should be applied only and
allowed to remain over night; and people who travel
much will find a supply of tea a valuable accompaniment,
as it is found to improve the taste and counteract the
effects of the most brackish water, proving efficient also
in preventing the dysenteric and diarrhetic results produced
by the frequent and extreme changes of drinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>waters. It is for the purpose of qualifying the water
expressly that tea is so generally used in China, as very
little good drinking water is to be met with in any part
of that country.</p>

<p class='c009'>With brain-workers it has always been a favorite
beverage, the subdued irascibility, the refreshed spirits,
and the renewed energies which the student so often
owes to it, have been the theme of many an accomplished
pen. Yet it is impossible to speak too strongly against
the not uncommon habit frequently adopted by ardent
students when prosecuting their studies far into the night,
to resist the claims of nature for repose, and keep off
the natural sleepiness by repeated libations of tea. That
it answers the purpose for the time being cannot be
denied, but the object is often attained at a fearful price,
the persistent adoption of such a practice being certain
to lead to the utter destruction of the health and vigor
of both body and mind. Less injury in such cases will
result from the use of coffee, there being this difference
between the morbid states of the nervous system produced
by coffee and that resulting from tea. The effect
of the former generally subsides or disappears entirely
on relinquishing its use, while that caused by tea is more
permanent and often incapable of being ever eradicated.</p>

<p class='c009'>That tea does not suit all temperaments, constitutions
and all ages is no valid argument against its general use.
That it is less adapted to children than adults is admitted;
indeed, for very young children it is entirely improper,
producing in them, like all narcotics, a morbid state of
the brain and nervous system in general. It is also
unsuited to those of an irritable temperament as well as
for those of a leuco-phlegmatic constitution, such persons
illy bearing much liquid of any kind, particularly in the
evening, prospering best on a dry diet at all times, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>to which young children especially should be strictly
confined. Briefly it may be summed up that tea is best
suited to persons in health, the plethoric and sanguine,
and upon which principle it is the proper diet at the
beginning of fevers and all inflammatory complaints.
Besides the more obvious effects with which all who use
it are familiar, tea saves food by lessening the waste of
the body, thus nourishing the muscular system while it
excites the nervous to increased activity, for which reason
old and infirm persons derive more benefit and personal
comfort from its use than from any corresponding beverage.
To the question “does tea produce nervousness?”
the answer is “in moderation, emphatically No!” One
to two cups of tea prepared moderately strong, even when
taken two to three times per day will not make any one
nervous, but when drunk to excess it undoubtedly will.
Tea-testers and experts who are tasting it all the time,
day in and day out, for the purpose of valuing it, are frequently
made nervous by it, soon recover by a little
abstinence. Tea, like liquor and drugs, when taken in
moderate quantities, produce one effect, but when used
in large and immoderate quantities produce just the contrary
result. China and Japan teas, containing more
theine and less tannin, are consequently less hurtful and
more refreshing than India and Ceylon teas, which contain
nearly double the quantity of tannin, the astringent
property to which India and Ceylon teas owe the harsh,
bitter taste so often complained of in them, and which is
undoubtedly the unsuspected cause of the indigestion
and nervousness produced by their use.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>DIETICAL PROPERTIES.</h3>

<p class='c015'>That the universal employment of tea has displaced
many other kinds of food is certain, and regarding its
dietical properties much has been written for and against.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>While some physicians have praised its value as an article
of food, on account of the large proportion of nitrogen
which it contains, others have as strenuously maintained
that it is non-nutritious, and does not serve as a substitute
for food, and that the only beneficial properties it
contains are due to the milk and sugar added in its use.
So that in considering the nourishing effects of tea, the
nutriment contained in the milk and sugar certainly must
not be overlooked, neither must the powerful influence
of the heat of the steaming draught be forgotten. According
to the chemical classification of food, the “flesh
formers” contained in tea of average quality is about 18,
and the “heat givers” 72 per cent., water and “mineral
matter” being divided between the residue, the several
constituents as they are found in one pound of good tea
being as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>The use of <i>theine</i> as an article of diet has not so far
been satisfactorily determined; but that it is a question
of no mean interest is obvious when we consider that it
is found to exist in so many plants, differing widely in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>their botanical origin and yet all instinctively used for
the same purpose, by remotely situated nations, for the
production of useful, agreeable and refreshing beverages.</p>

<p class='c009'>By taking the normal temperature of the human body
at 98°, it follows that where food is taken into the stomach
of a lower temperature than that of the body it must
necessarily abstract heat from the stomach and surrounding
tissues, so that where the practice of taking cold
food becomes habitual depression occurs and the
stomach is consequently disordered, and the system
must make good this heat lost in raising the temperature
of cold food or else suffer. The body demanding food
when in an exhausted state, cold food or drink makes an
immediate drain upon the system for heat before it can
supply material for producing combustion, and the body
is thereby taxed to supply heat at a time when it is least
fitted for it. It is natural, therefore, that there should be
a craving for warm food, and as liquid food is deficient
in heat-giving matter, the use of cold drink is more
injurious than that of cold food. From other experiments
it appears that the introduction into the stomach of three
or four grains of <i>theine</i>, which is the quantity contained
in the third of an ounce of good tea, has the remarkable
effect of diminishing the daily waste or disintegration of
the bodily tissues which may be measured by the quantity
of solid constituents contained in the many secretions, and
if such waste be lessened the necessity for food to repair
that waste will obviously be decreased in corresponding
proportions. In other words, says Professor Johnstone,
“by the consumption of a certain quantity of tea daily the
health and strength of the body will be maintained to an
equal degree upon a smaller supply of ordinary food.” Tea,
therefore, saves food; stands to a certain extent in place
of food, while at the same time it soothes the body and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>enlivens the mind. While tea, according to Dr. Sigmond,
“has in most instances been substituted for spirituous
liquors, and the consequence has been a general improvement
in the health and morals of the people, the
time, strength, and vigor of the human body being
increased by its use. It imparts greater capability of
enduring fatigue, and renders the mind more susceptible
of the innocent and intellectual pleasures of life,
as well as of acquiring useful knowledge more readily,
being not only a stimulant to the mental faculties but
also the most beneficial drink to those engaged in any
laborious or fatiguing work.<a id='tn227'></a>” Dr. Jackson testifying
“that a breakfast of tea and bread alone is much more
strengthening than one of beefsteak and porter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In his admirable work on hygiene Dr. Parker remarks
that “tea possesses a decidedly stimulating and restorative
action on the human system, no depression whatever
following its use, the pulse being a little quickened, and
the amount of pulmonary carbonic acid accordingly increased.”
From this experiment he regards “tea as a
most useful article of diet for soldiers, the hot infusion
being potent against heat and cold, and more useful still
in great fatigue in tropical countries by its great purifying
effect on brackish and stagnant water.” Adding that
“tea is so light, easily carried and so readily prepared,
that it should form the drink, <i>par excellence</i>, of the soldier
in service or on the march, above all its power of lessening
the susceptibility to malarial and other influences.” And
Admiral Inglefield is quoted as strongly recommending
the use of tea to Arctic travelers and explorers, as seamen
who surveyed with him in the polar regions after an experience
of one day’s rum drinking came to the conclusion
that tea was more beneficial to them while undergoing
the severe work and intense cold. Under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>infirmities of advancing age, especially when the digestive
powers become enfeebled and the size and weight of the
body begin perceptibly to diminish, the value of tea in
checking the rapid waste of tissue is particularly <a id='tn228'></a>observable,
and persons, when very much fatigued, will be
sooner refreshed by drinking a cup of moderately strong,
good tea, than by drinking wine or spirits of any kind.
In allaying or satisfying severe thirst, no beverage will
be found as efficacious as a draught of cold tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lettson furnishes a calculation, partly his own and
partly from other sources, in which he endeavors to
prove how much is, in his view, unnecessarily expended
by the poor for tea. But the observations of Liebig, if
correct, and in all probability they are, offer a satisfactory
explanation of the cause of the partiality of the poorer
classes, not alone for tea, but for tea of an expensive and
therefore superior quality. “We shall never certainly,”
he says, “be able to discover how people were led to the
use of hot infusions of the leaves of a certain shrub (tea)
or a decoction of certain roasted seeds (coffee); some
cause there must be which would explain how the
practice has become a necessary of life to whole nations.”
But it is still more remarkable that the beneficial effects
of both plants on the health must be ascribed to one and
the same substance, the presence of which in two vegetables
belonging to natural families, the product of different
quarters of the globe, could hardly have presented itself
to the boldest imagination, recent research having shown
in such a manner as to exclude all doubt that the
<i>caffeine</i> of coffee and the <i>theine</i> of tea are in all respects
identical. And without entering into the medical action
of this principle, it will surely appear a most startling
fact, even if we deny its influence on the process of
secretion, that this substance, with the addition of oxygen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>and the elements of water, can yield <i>taurine</i>, the nitrogenous
compound peculiar to bile. So that if an infusion
of tea contain no more than 1-10 of a grain of theine,
and contributes, as has been shown, to the formation of
bile, the action, even of a such a small quantity, cannot
be looked upon as a nullity. Neither can it be deemed
that in the case of non-atomized food or a deficiency of
the exercise required to cause a change of matter in the
tissues, and thus to yield the nitrogenized product which
enters into the composition of bile, the health may be
benefited by the use of compounds essential to the
production of this important element of respiration. In
a chemical sense, and it is this sense alone that theine is
in virtue of its composition better adapted to this purpose
than all other nitrogenized vegetable principles yet
discovered. To better prove how the action of tea may
be explained, we must call to mind that the chief constituents
of the bile contain only 3.8 per cent. of nitrogen,
of which only one-half belongs to the <i>taurine</i>. Bile contains
in its natural state water and solid matter in the proportion
of 90 parts of the former to 10 parts of the latter,
and if, we suppose, these 10 parts of solid matter to be
cholenic acid with 5.87 per cent. of nitrogen, then 100
parts of bile must contain 0.171 of nitrogen in the form
of taurine, which quantity is contained in .06 parts of
theine, or, in other words, 272 grains of theine can give
to an ounce of bile the quantity of nitrogen it contains
in the form of taurine. The action of the compound
in ordinary circumstances is not obvious, but that it
unquestionably exists and exerts itself in both tea and
coffee is proven by the fact that both were originally met
with among nations whose diet was chiefly vegetable.
These facts clearly show in what manner tea proves to
the poor a substitute for animal food, and why it is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>females, literary persons and others of sedentary habits or
occupation, who take but little exercise, manifest such a
partiality for tea, and also explain why the numerous
attempts made to substitute other articles in its place
have so signally failed.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>TEA AS A STIMULANT.</h3>

<p class='c015'>“Life without stimulants would be a dreary waste,”
remarks some modern philosopher, which, if true, the
moderate use of good tea, properly prepared and not too
strong, will be found less harmful than the habitual resort
to alcoholic liquors. The impression so long existing
that vinous or alcoholic beverages best excite the brain
and cause it to produce more or better work is rapidly
being exploded, healthier and more beneficial stimulants
usurping their place. But while the claims made in
favor of the “wine cup” must be admitted, it cannot for
a moment be denied that as excellent literary work has
been accomplished under the influence of tea, in our own
times, particularly when the poet, the essayist, the historian,
the statesman and the journalist no longer work
under the baneful influence of spirituous stimulants.
Mantegaza, an Italian <a id='tn230'></a>physiologist of high repute, who
has given the action of tea and other stimulants careful
study, confirms this claim by placing tea above all other
stimulants, his enthusiasm for it being almost unbounded,
crediting it with “the power of dispelling weariness and
lessening the annoyances of life, classing it as the greatest
friend to the man of letters by enabling him to work
without fatigue, and to society as an aid to conversation,
rendering it more easy and pleasant, reviving the drooping
intellectual activity and the best stimulus to exertion,
and finally pronouncing it to be one of the greatest blessings
of Providence to man.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Tea was Johnson’s only stimulant, he loved it as much
as Porson loved gin, drinking it all times and under all
circumstances, in bed and out, with his friends and alone,
more particularly while compiling his famous dictionary.
Boswell drank cup after cup, as if it had been the “Heliconian
spring.” While <a id='tn231a'></a>Hazlitt, like Johnson, was a
<a id='tn231b'></a>prodigious tea-drinker, Shelley’s favorite beverage was
water, but at the same time tea was always grateful to
him. Bulwer’s breakfast was generally composed of dry
toast and cold tea, and De Quincy states that he invariably
drank tea from eight o’clock at night until four in
the morning, when engaged in his literary labors, and
knew whereof he spoke when he named tea “the beverage
of the intellectual.” Kent usually had a cup of tea
and a pipe of tobacco, on which he worked eight hours
at a stretch, and Motley, the historian tells us that he
“usually rose at seven, and with the aid of a cup of tea
only, wrote until eleven.” And Victor Hugo, as a
general rule, used tea freely, but fortifying it with a little
brandy. Turning from literature to politics, we find that
Palmerston resorted to tea during the midnight sessions
of Parliament. Cobden declaring “the more work he had
to do the more tea he drank,” and Gladstone himself
confesses to drinking large quantities of tea between
midnight and morning during the prolonged parliamentary
sittings, while Clemenceau, the leader of the French
Radicals, admits himself to be “an intemperate tea-drinker”
during the firey discussions of debate.</p>

<p class='c009'>In moderation, tea is pre-eminently the beverage of the
twilight hour, when tired humanity seeks repose after
a day of wearying labor. Then the hot infusion
with its alluring aroma refreshing and stimulating,
increasing the respiration, elevating the pulse, softening
the temper, producing tranquility in mind and body,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>and creating a sense of repose peculiarly grateful to
those who have been taxed and tormented by the rush
and routine of business cares and vexations. What a
promoter of sociability, what home comforts does it not
suggest, as, when Cowper, on a winter’s evening, draws a
cheerful picture of the crackling fire, the curtained windows,
the hissing urn and “the cup that cheers?” When,
however, tea drinking ceases to be the amusement of the
leisure moment or resorted to in too large quantities or
strong infusions as a means of stimulating the flagging
energies to accomplish the allotted task, whatever it
might be, then distinct danger commences. A breakdown
is liable to ensue in more than one way, as not
infrequently the stimulus which tea in time fails to give
is sought in alcoholic or other liquors, and the atonic
dyspepsia which the astringent decoction produced, by
overdrawing induces, helps to drive the victim to seek
temporary relief in spirits chloral or the morphine habit,
which is established with extraordinary rapidity. For it is
a truth that as long as a person uses stimulants simply for
their taste he is comparatively safe, but as soon as he
begins to drink them for effect he is running into great
danger. This may be stating the case too forcibly for
stimulants, but if this rule was more closely adhered to
we should have fewer cases of educated people falling into
the habit of secret intemperance or morphomania.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>TEA AND THE POETS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The subdued irascibility, the refreshed spirits, and the
renewed energies which the student and the poet so often
owed to tea has been the theme of many an accomplished
pen, eminent writers of all times and all countries considering
it no indignity to extol the virtues of this
precious and fascinating beverage. What Bacchanalian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>and hunting songs, cavalier and sea songs, <a id='tn233a'></a>rhapsodies and
laudations of other subjects have been to our literature,
such was tea to the writers, poets, artists and musicians of
China and Japan, <a id='tn233b'></a>theirs being confined to the simple subject—Tea.
Each plantation was supposed to possess its
own peculiar virtues and excellences, not unlike the vineyards
of the Rhine, the Rhone and the Moselle, each had
its poet to sing its praises in running rhymes. One
Chinese bard, who seemingly was an Anacreon in his
way, magnifying the product of the Woo-e-shan mountains
in terms literally translated as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One ounce does all disorders cure.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With two your troubles will be fewer,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Three to the bones more vigor give,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With four forever you will live</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As young as on your day of birth,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A true immortal on the earth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>However hyperbolical this testimony may be considered,
it at least serves to show the high estimation in
which the plant was held in China.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first literary eulogist to espouse the cause of the
new drink in Europe was Edmund Waller, reciting how
he became first induced to taste it. In a poem containing
several references to the leaf occurs the following pregnant
allusion to tea:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The muses friend doth our fancy aid,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Repress these vapors which the head invade,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Keeping that palace of the soul serene.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>That Queen Anne ranked among its votaries is manifest
from Pope’s celebrated couplet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Though great Anna, whom the realms obey,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Doth sometimes counsel take and—sometimes Tea.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Johnson did not make verses in its honor, but he has
drawn his own portrait as “a hardened and shameless tea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>drinker, who for twenty years diluted his meals with an
infusion of this fascinating plant, whose kettle had scarcely
time to cool, who with tea amused the evening, with tea
solaced the night, and with tea welcomed the morning.”
While Brady, in his well-known metrical version of the
psalms, thus illustrates its advantages:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Over our tea conversations we employ,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where with delight instructions we enjoy,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Quaffing without waste of time or wealth</div>
      <div class='line'><i>The soverign drink of pleasure and of health</i>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Cooper’s praise of the beverage has been sadly hackneyed,
nevertheless, as the Laureate of the tea table, his
lines are worthy of reproduction here:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“While the bubbling and loud hissing urn</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Throws up a steaming column, and the cup</div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>That cheers, but not inebriates</i>, wait on each,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So let us welcome peaceful evening in.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>That Coleridge, in his younger days, must have liked
tea is inferred from the following stanza:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Though all unknown to Greek and Roman song,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The paler Hyson and the dark Souchong,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which Kieu-lung, imperial poet praised</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So high that cent, per cent. its price was raised.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Gray eulogizing it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“Through all the room</div>
      <div class='line'>From flowing tea exhales a fragrant fume.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Byron, in his latter years, became an enthusiast on the
use of tea, averring that he “Must have recourse to
black Bohea,” still later pronouncing Green tea to be
the “Chinese nymph of tears.” And in addition to the
praises sung to it by English-speaking poets and essayists,
its virtues have also been sounded by Herricken and
Francius in Greek verse, by Pecklin, in Latin epigraphs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>by Pierre Pettit, in a poem of five hundred lines, as well
as by a German versifier, who celebrated, in a fashion of
his own, “The burial and happy resurrection of tea.” In
opposition to the “country parson,” who calls tea “a
nerveless and vaporous liquid,” and Balzac, who describes
it as an “insipid and depressing beverage,” the author
of “Eothen” records his testimony to “the cheering,
soothing influence of the steaming cup that Orientals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>and Europeans alike enjoy.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_4 c008'>The first direct importation of tea into England
was in 1669, and consisted of but “100 pounds
of the best tea that could be procured.” In 1678
this order was increased to 4,713 pounds, which appears
to have “glutted the market;” the following six years the
total importations amounting to only 410 pounds during
that entire period. How little was it possible from
these figures to have foreseen that tea would one day
become one of the most important articles of foreign
productions consumed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to 1864 China and Japan were practically the only
countries producing teas for commercial purposes. In
that year India first entered the list as an exporter
of tea, being subsequently followed by Java and Ceylon.
In 1864, when India first entered the list of tea-producing
countries, China furnished fully 97 per cent.
of the world’s supply and India only 3, the latter increasing
at such a marvelous rate that it now furnishes 57,
China declining to 43 per cent. of the total.</p>

<p class='c009'>From these estimates it will be observed that England
ranks first in the list of tea-consuming countries, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>United States second, and Russia third, the Australian
colonies and Canada coming next in order, comparatively
little tea being used in France, Germany and the other
European countries. It is rarely used in some parts of
the globe, and is practically unknown in a great many
other countries. It is also apparent that 90 per cent. of
the world’s supply is chiefly consumed by English-speaking
people, fully 75 per cent. of this being used by England
and her dependencies alone, the United States being
next in importance as a tea-consuming country. And it
may here be noted that while the world’s production of tea
has been very largely increased during the last quarter of
a century in greater ratio than that of any other of the
great staples of commerce, the production of China and
Japan having increased at least 50 per cent. in that period,
to which must be added that of India and Ceylon, from
which countries little or none was received until a few
years ago. Yet it cannot be said that the consumption
has increased in anything like the same proportion, which
will account for the great decline in price in later years,
and to prevent prices from going still lower it is evident
that new markets must be opened up for its sale in other
countries where it has not yet been introduced.</p>

<p class='c009'>In England, particularly, the increase in the consumption
of tea in late years borders on the marvelous, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>figures for 1890 reaching upwards of 195,000,000 pounds,
which, at the present rate of increase, will, in all probability,
exceed 200,000,000 in 1892, as in the quarter of
a century between 1865 and 1890 the consumption rose
from 3½ to 5 pounds <i>per capita</i> of the population. But
as in the latter half of that period strong India teas were
more freely used, being increased appreciably by the
similar Ceylon product in the closing years of that time
largely displacing the lighter liquored teas of China, a
larger consumption is indicated by the number of gallons
of liquid yielded. This is calculated on the moderate
estimate formed in a report to the Board of Custom to
the effect that if one pound of China leaf produces five
gallons of liquor of a certain depth of color and body,
one pound of India tea will yield seven and a half
gallons of a similar beverage. Then by allowing for an
apparent arrest of the advancing consumption when the
process of displacement was only commencing, the
increase in the consumption of tea in the British Islands
has not only been steady but rapid; thus, from 17 gallons
per head in 1865 to 24 in 1876, 28 in 1886, reaching
33½ gallons per head per annum in 1890, the figures of
last year almost exactly doubling that of the first year of
the series, so that in consequence of the introduction of
the stronger products of India and Ceylon the people of
Britain have been enabled to double their consumption
of the beverage, although the percentage of increase in
the leaf has been only from 3½ to 5 pounds during the
same period. Ceylon tea, which a decade ago was only
beginning to intrude itself as a new and suspiciously regarded
competitor in the English market with products
so well known and established as the teas of China and
India, has recently made such rapid progress that its
position in the British market in 1890, rated by home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>consumption, occupying third place on the list. India
teas 52 per cent., China 30 per cent., Ceylon 18 per cent.</p>

to an average of 36 cents per pound, the consumption
increased to the heretofore unprecedented figures of
107,000,000 pounds, while in 1888, when the average price
was again reduced to 20 cents, owing to the enormous
increase in the production of India and Ceylon teas, the
total consumption became augmented to 185,000,000
pounds, comprised as follows, in round numbers:—</p>

<p class='c009'>The latter, for the first time on record, exceeding that
of China teas, being an almost exact inversion of the
figures of 1886 in favor of India and Ceylon teas, by which
it will be seen that China is year by year becoming of less
importance as a source of tea supply to English consumers.
And as the demand becomes greater the importations
from India and Ceylon are constantly expanding, prices
being correspondingly reduced to an unprecedentedly
low figure, being now so cheap in the United Kingdom
as to be in daily use in almost every household. The

<p class='c009'>The proportion of Black tea consumed in England is
about as 5 to 1, the <i>per capita</i> consumption ranging from
5 to 6 pounds for the entire population.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ceylon teas continue to grow in public favor to a
marvelous extent in England and beyond anticipating in
the natural growth of consumption, they help fill up the
yearly displacement of China teas. The total production
for 1890 was nearly 38,000,000 pounds against over
30,000,000 pounds for 1889, and 18,500,000 pounds for
1888, thus showing an increase of 19,500,000 pounds for
the two years. The supply for 1891 is about 40,000,000
pounds, the stock being increased 3,000,000 pounds,
which may be considered very moderate and quite steady
considering the steady all-round demand there is for Ceylon
teas in that country. But there is not the slightest
doubt but that the check which the consumption of China
tea appears to have sustained in England is entirely due
to the <i>forced</i> use of India and Ceylon teas in that country
and her dependencies, there being a positive revulsion of
taste in many sections in favor of the truer, purer and
more delicate and richer of China teas. Medical opinions
have been recently given to prove that the excessive
quantity of tannin contained in India and Ceylon teas is
very injurious to health, and a revival of the Chinese tea-trade
may be confidently expected in the future.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far as the English tea-trade is concerned the market
for China and Japan teas is now but a tame affair to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>what it was only a few years ago, little interest being
taken there in the tea product of these countries. Year
by year since 1885 China and Japan teas has had less
hold upon the English market, and it is remarkable to
note how continuously the consumption of these varieties
have been on the decline there from that time, notwithstanding
their superior merits in drawing and drinking
qualities over both India and Ceylons. In that year their
consumption in the British isles amounted to over
113,000,000 pounds, but fell off to less than 105,000,000
pounds in 1886, to about 90,000,000 in 1887, to 80,000,000
in 1888, to 60,000,000 in 1889. The quantity of China and
Japan teas consumed in the whole United Kingdom declining
to about 50,000,000 pounds in 1890, although the prices
for them were exceedingly low during that period.
There are two main causes for this serious reduction
which have been in operation simultaneously and for a
length of time. The first was the great competition of
India teas stimulated for the reasons already named, and
the second cause the extraordinary favor that Ceylon
teas found with English consumers in 1888, when the
quantity imported for use from that island amounted to
18,500,000 pounds, or nearly double of what it was the
preceding year, the quantities cleared for 1889 and 1890
being respectively 28,500,000 pounds and 34,500,000
pounds, showing an astonishing increase within the short
space of three years, and which fully accounts for the
decadence of the English demand for China and Japan
teas. The consumption of the latter varieties has retrograded
there, while that for India and Ceylon teas has
increased proportionately, so that, although the market
for the former descriptions has occasionally given signs
of revival, they have been only spasmodic efforts at
recovering, the much expected and promised reaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>soon subsiding. And instead of the phenomenal cheapness
of China and Japans being regarded as a recommendation
to consumers it has been used as an argument
by British dealers as an evidence of their unpopularity,
and so completely has the demand been transferred
from China and Japan teas to Indias and Ceylons that it
has been no uncommon occurrence for the latter kinds
to be selling at improving rates whilst the former descriptions
have been disposable only at drooping prices.</p>

<p class='c009'>The enormous size of the tea estates in India and
Ceylon as compared with the small gardens of China
and Japan give the growers in the former countries
several advantages over those in the latter as they can
be worked more systematically and with less expense in
larger areas. The use of machinery in curing and firing
also lessens the cost of preparation for market, together
with a saving in freight and quicker sale consequent to
English preferences giving a speedier return for the
money invested. The advantages which India and Ceylon
tea-growers have over those of China are greater command
of capital, as in both India and Ceylon tea estates
are generally owned by companies consisting of shareholders
whose living is not dependent on the product of
the plantations. The companies can consequently afford
to carry on the business at a loss for several years, can
purchase extensive tea lands, and can spend large sums
on machinery, labor and experiments as well as on agents
to introduce and distribute them. The India and Ceylon
tea-growers can obtain loans at a lower rate of interest,
borrowing money at from 4 to 5 per cent., while their
Chinese competitors have to pay from 20 to 30 per cent.
for the same accommodations, in addition to a command
of better chemical and agricultural knowledge. But
against these admitted advantages of India and Ceylon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>China possesses one great advantage, that is, that the
Chinese grower, working for himself instead of wages,
brings greater care and more industry to the task.
Experience with him takes the place of science, and he is
thus enabled to produce a finer flavored tea than has yet
or ever will be produced in either India or Ceylon. Again
the great decline in the consumption of China teas in
England and her dependencies cannot be attributed, as is
so loudly proclaimed by her statisticians, to any falling off in
the quality of China teas or any inherent merit possessed
by those of India or Ceylon, but simply to the narrow
and contracted policy of her merchants of favoring and
forcing the product of her colonies to the prejudice if not
positive exclusion of that of the older tea-growing
countries.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1865 China exported over 120,000,000 pounds of
tea, in 1870 nearly 170,000,000 pounds, in 1880 over
214,000,000 pounds, reaching the enormous total of
221,000,000 pounds in 1890, thus China’s export has
also been increasing in a proportionate degree. But
although the figures for 1870 and 1890 show that in
twenty years it has nearly doubled, still it is not such a
remarkable increase relatively when compared with that
of India, which during the same period has increased
nearly fourteen fold in quantity. In estimating the
probability of a recovery in the position of China teas
in the markets of the world the following considerations
are of interest on the subject: First, <a id='tn245'></a>it is well known
that the heavy <i>Likin</i> (grower’s tax) <i>Kutang</i> (transit
dues) and export duties levied on tea have contributed
in a great measure to the decadence of the tea-trade in
that country and to the development of that of India and
Ceylon, where the article, at least, starts free and unencumbered.
The Chinese laboring under this disadvantage, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the outset, have endeavored to compete with India and
Ceylon by reducing the cost of production and lowering
their standard of quality with a consequent deterioration
in the grade of the leaf. This changed condition of
the tea-trade may be attributed to these specific causes.
Fifty years ago India and Ceylon produced no tea, as it
was not until 1840 that the export from the former
began with a small venture of 400 pounds, since that
year, however, the increase has been both rapid and
striking. Thus, commencing in 1840, the export has
steadily increased year after year until now, when the
average annual production reaches 100,000,000 pounds, of
which England consumes some 97,000,000 pounds, the
balance going to Australia and other of her colonies.
It is contended by the Chinese themselves that if the
Likin and export duties were removed entirely or the
export duty alone reduced to an <i>ad valorem</i> charge of 5
per cent. it would greatly help those engaged in the
China tea-trade in their competition with the growers
and shippers of India and Ceylon, others holding that
a simple reduction of the duty will not permanently
benefit the China tea-trade unless it enables China to lay
down teas in Europe and America at a less price than
can be done by either India or Ceylon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Russia is now regarded as the main hope of Chinese
Congous and sorts, the British islands consuming
Indias and Ceylons almost exclusively, the United States
favoring Oolongs and Japans principally. The trade in
China teas with Russia is increasing annually, while it is
decreasing with England. In former years tea was first
shipped to England and thence to Russia, the Russian
tea-dealers now purchasing direct from China. The
Russian demand seems, in fact, to grow as fast as that
from England declines, constituting a total which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>hardly suspected by those who are interested in the trade,
so that, although ousted from her monopoly, China has
still a great market for her produce.</p>

<p class='c009'>Great quantities of tea are consumed in the domains of
the Czar and it is believed that the Russians use as much
tea <i>per capita</i> as the Chinese themselves. The “Samovar”
or tea-urn is always steaming and the natives never
cease sipping tea while there is water left to make it. It is
served at all hours of the day, in palace as well as hovel,
being regarded as much a necessary of life there as bread
or tobacco. Shops abound for its sale in the principal
cities; bargains made and business transactions sealed
over steaming tumblers of tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first duty levied on tea by the United States was
in 1789, when a tax of 15 cents was imposed on all Black
teas, 22 cents on Imperial and Gunpowder, and 55 cents
on Young Hyson. But in order to stimulate American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>shipping these duties were reduced to 8, 13 and 26 cents
respectively, the following year, when imported from
Europe in American vessels, and to 6, 10 and 20 cents
when imported direct from China in the same manner.
In 1794, however, the rates were increased 75 per cent.
on direct importations, and 100 per cent. on all teas
shipped from Europe, but again reduced to 12,18 and 32
cents in 1796, the latter rates being doubled during the
War of 1812. In 1828 this tax was again reduced, being
entirely removed in 1830, except when imported in foreign
bottoms, when a duty of 10 cents per pound was
collected. The latter rate continued in force up to the
outbreak of the Rebellion in 1861, when a uniform duty
of 15 cents per pound was placed on all teas, which was
eventually increased to 20 cents and finally to 25 cents
per pound. In January, 1871, this duty was reduced to
15 cents, being entirely removed in July, 1872, since
which year tea has been uninterruptedly on the free list
in the United States.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, there was
imported into the United States, at all ports, 84,627,870
pounds of tea, of which 43,043,651 pounds were received
from China and 37,627,560 pounds from Japan, the balance
consisting of imports from India, Java and Ceylon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>received <i>via</i> England and Holland. The United States
official reports show that tea represents 27 per cent. of
the total value of imported merchandise into this
country. The gross trade in the article, however, even
at retail prices, does not exceed $35,000,000, the
total annual value of all food products being about
$220,000,000, of which tea only represents a value of
$13,000,000, equivalent to about 6 per cent. of the
whole.</p>

<p class='c009'>In round numbers the consumption of tea in the principal
importing countries has increased from 350,000,000
pounds in 1880 to upwards of 400,000,000 pounds in 1892.
To which may be added for the minor consuming countries
another 60,000,000 pounds, in which case we get a
grand total of 460,000,000 pounds. Tea consumption in
India and Ceylon is scarce worth computing, and it is
also claimed that the consumption in China has been
greatly exaggerated, for although the Chinese drink tea
constantly much of the liquor is little different from hot
water, so that to credit China and her feudatories with
another 500,000,000 pounds would be an extravagant
estimate. But, admitting it to be near the mark, we may
then take in round numbers 1,000,000,000 pounds of leaf,
or say 6,000,000,000 gallons, as the world’s annual consumption
of tea. But it is confidently predicted that
if peace be preserved and wealth and civilization continues
to advance that much greater increase during the closing
years of the present century and the whole of the twentieth
century—for large portions of mankind are at length
discovering that alcohol with its “borrowed fire” is a
deceiver and a curse. If the civilization of an age or a
community can be tested by the quantity of sulphuric
acid which it uses, much more certainly can the moral
status of a time and a people be judged by a comparison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>of the quantities of alcoholic and non-alcoholic stimulants
it uses.</p>

<p class='c009'>All teas have declined one-half in value during the past
ten years, owing to the increased production of India and
Ceylon, the position of the market at the present time is,
however, unique and unusual. Heretofore the rule has
been for the supply to exceed the demand, particularly
of China tea, it being the custom to claim that the market
would never run short of the latter, as the production
could be increased to meet any sudden or excessive demand.
Now, however, the position is entirely different,
the shortage in China tea the past year reaching some
21,000,000 pounds, to which must be added the increase
in consumption of 11,500,000 pounds, due in a measure
to the reduction of the duty in England, against which
deficit is to be placed the increase of production in India
of 3,000,000 pounds, and that of Ceylon of 15,000,000
pounds, but still leaving a shortage of 14,000,000
pounds. This position has led to an advance in China
common grades, part of which is undoubtedly due to
speculation. With decreased imports and increased consumption
in the market, however, appears to have all the
requisite of strength to sustain it, and it will be years
before it reaches its late low point again.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the great reduction in importation price and
keener competition the retail prices have been brought
down to a very low figure, and as the dealer has educated
the public to the purchase of poor teas at low
prices it is not likely that the retail prices of teas will ever
reach any higher figure unless war or other cause should
lead to a duty being placed on the article. Yet, notwithstanding
these unprecedented low prices, the <i>per capita</i>
consumption of tea is comparatively very low in this
country at the present time, one of the chief causes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>being traceable to the custom prevalent among dealers
of charging exorbitant profits in order to make up for
the losses made in other goods. This impolitic practice
may be forgiven were it not for the greater mistake they
make of sacrificing quality to profit, which in articles of
daily use like tea is an important consideration. By
rectifying this error, and giving more attention to the
careful selection of their teas, there is no valid reason
why the consumption of tea in this country could not
at the least calculation be doubled, more particularly in
the present state of the coffee market, as it is generally
calculated that one pound of good tea equals four pounds
of coffee in amount and strength of its extract, besides
being cheaper and more convenient to prepare. Under
these circumstances it may be assumed that there is no
probability of any material change in the cost of tea to
the dealer and there should be no further reduction in
the selling price to the consumer, any further reduction
in the retail price involving a diminution of profit which
the trade can ill afford to bear at the present time.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c007'>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_4 c008'>In 1858 the United States Government ordered and
received about 10,000 tea-plants from China in
Wardian cases in which the seeds were sown just
previous to shipment, many of them germinated during
the voyage, the plants averaging 18 inches in height
on their arrival in this country. Being immediately
placed under propagation they were in a very short time
increased to over 30,000, which were widely distributed
throughout the Southern States, the propagation and distribution
of tea-plants forming a prominent feature in the
operations of the Agricultural Department up to the
commencement of the civil war in 1861, which put a stop
to all experiments in the industry. For several years
after its close but little attention was given to the propagation
of the plant in this country, still at no time was
it entirely abandoned by the Department during this
period. It being fully understood, that so far as the
growth of the plant was concerned it could undoubtedly
be successfully cultivated over a large extent of the
country. But many of those interested sharing in the
belief that the amount and cost of the manual labor
required in its manipulation for market was so great as
to preclude the probability of competing with low-waged
Asiatics, no special efforts were again made to disseminate
plants or to multiply them further than to supply
such applicants as desired to make experimental tests.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Meanwhile the progress of tea-culture in India was
watched with interest. The successful results of modern
methods of cultivation and the introduction of various
labor-saving machines for preparation which were being
made from time to time by the planters of that country,
suggesting the probability that the production of tea
could eventually be made a profitable industry in many
sections of this country, where labor-saving appliances
usually follow closely upon the knowledge of their
necessity. Basing their hopes on these results, fresh
supplies of tea-seed were subsequently imported from
Japan, which enabled the Department to again distribute
many thousand of plants throughout the country.
These renewed efforts being materially enhanced, when
about 1867 it was found that an abundance of tea-seeds
could be procured in many of the Southern States from
the plants which had previously been disseminated from
the importation of 1858. Encouraged by the reports of
successful culture which were in many cases supplemented
by samples of manufactured tea, of undoubted
good quality, in a number of instances, more decided
and energetic efforts were made toward establishing the
industry. More than 100,000 tea-plants were distributed
during the past ten years, the Department having under
propagation, at the present time, over 20,000 plants which
are ready for dissemination in localities where they are
most likely to succeed. By this means it is expected to
popularize the cultivation of tea as a domestic product
in this country, with the hope that public interest will in
time be directed to its cultivation as an article of commercial
value also.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cultivation of the tea-plant is as simple as that of
the currant or gooseberry, and tea-gardens may be established
in a similar manner to those of other economic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>plants. They are usually divided into five and ten-acre
sections, and in laying out must be kept as much as
possible together, being easier to supervise and cheaper
to work in this manner. The usual custom is to begin
at one end and dig through to the other, as different
parts of the garden may require different treatment owing
to a variation in the soil or other causes. The lines
of plants must run as far as practicable in geometrical
regularity, particularly in sloping ground, never up and
down or directly across the slope. If planted in the
former manner, gutters or watercourses will form between
the lines and the soil will be washed away, and if in the
latter, the same injury will result between the shrubs<a id='tn255'></a>.
The lower side of each plant having its roots laid bare,
the sun will act upon them, thereby causing the plants
to shrivel up, languish and die. But if the lines are laid
diagonally across the hill so that the slopes along the
lines shall be moderate ones, this drawback is reduced as
far as can be under the circumstances. The closer the
lines to each other and the closer the plants in the lines
the less will be the wash. While on flat lands it does
not signify in which direction the lines run, the gardens
so situated always looks best when the lines run at right
angles.</p>

<p class='c009'>That the successful cultivation of the Tea plant is
entirely practicable in the United States has been abundantly
proven, and that we may by a more extensive and
intelligent effort in this direction, save the large amount
of money which we now annually pay to foreign countries
for this staple is at least worth a trial. So far as its
practicability is concerned there can be no question, as we
have within the various latitudes of our borders the soil
and climate to produce any plant that is or may be grown
in any other country. The doubts expressed as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>suitability of our soil and climate to produce as good an
article of tea as is now grown in India, Java and Ceylon
are untenable, all practical farmers being aware that
soils and climates exert certain influences upon all vegetation,
these same influences being potent everywhere,
and that natural causes are not spasmodic in their operations
anywhere. The latitudes in which teas are grown
in China, Japan and India correspond exactly with those
of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and Florida in the south,
and with that of Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama in the
southwest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while the question of making its production a
commercial success is conceded by many authorities,
some contend that while we can undoubtedly cultivate tea
of fair quality in many sections of the country, we cannot
supply the cheap and skilled labor necessary to prepare
it for market, advancing the argument that from the time
the leaves are picked until they are packed for export
they are subjected to a continued series of manipulations,
demanding an immense amount of such labor without
which it is next to impossible to produce a merchantable
article. But while it is admitted that the greater part of
the cost of tea in the producing countries is that of
labor, it must be taken into account that much of the
manipulation and packing of tea in these countries is for
the purpose of fitting it for the ocean voyages, and to
protect it during transportation the leaves must be
repeatedly fired and sorted before shipping, in order to
better protect them from damp and moisture in transit.
But even with all these extra firings and precautions
the original aroma developed by these processes is
largely dissipated before the tea reaches its destination in
the importing countries. It is a well-established fact
that the best teas are only to be had in their highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>excellence in the countries of growth, and then only before
they have been submitted to the severity of all the home
processes which they have to undergo previous to being
packed in the lead-lined chests for the long voyages, in
the holds of vessels. This superior article is entirely
unknown in the consuming countries, and is one of the
luxuries in store for us when tea-culture becomes one
of our industries. Thus, seeing that much of the care
bestowed upon the manufacture of tea is merely for
the purpose of meeting these commercial exactions,
both in regard to protecting its flavor as well as to its
appearance on arrival, it may be that by ignoring mere
appearance and style, as equally good a beverage may
be produced by an entirely different system of preparation
of the leaf for the home market. What has
already been accomplished by modern tea-manufacturers
in the way of improvements in India and Ceylon for
instance, upon the older pessimistic Chinese methods
only too aptly suggests that still further innovations
are yet possible. We secure the essential virtues
of other herbs and leaves without subjecting them
to such complicated and intricate processes, which,
after all, are mainly for the purpose of preventing the
leaves from moulding and decomposition in transit, and
there is no valid reason why tea should differ from the
leaves of other plants in this respect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet while admitting that the manufacture of tea as at
present conducted is, no doubt, a very particular and
tedious one, and that much of its supposed value is
dependent upon the uniform accuracy with which the
various processes are performed, this is more particularly
true of China tea where the difficulty is largely attributable
to the primitive nature of the methods employed
there, as contrasted with the more modern specific and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>exact system in use in India and other tea-growing
countries. It is yet possible for our inventors to produce
machinery for still further simplifying many of the intricate
processes now in use even in India and Ceylon.
The planters of the latter countries soon discovered
that they could not profitably follow the various minute
and detailed processes practiced by the Chinese and set
themselves to study the philosophy of the whole subject
of preparing the leaf for market, eventually mastering it.
The result has been that many operations which were
previously considered essential have now been either
reduced or dispensed with altogether in that country.
Instead of following the antiquated Chinese methods,
which involved some twelve different operations, occupying
three days, the best India teas are now prepared in
less than five operations, the entire process being completed
inside of two days. It may therefore be found
that for home use a less elaborate method of preparation
may suffice and that the article might enter into domestic
commerce. It could be prepared after the simple but
effective manner of Paraguayan tea, or put up in bales as
with hops, or it may be pressed into layers of dried leaves,
as is done with senna tea, and many other herbs at the
present time. The firing, which develops the aroma,
might be done immediately before use, as is now the case
with coffee, or better still, roasted and ground like that
article, the modern cylindrical method of roasting coffee
being a great improvement on the old style of hand and
pan roasting. Machinery being unknown to the Chinese
is probable the strongest reason why they still adhere so
closely to the antiquated methods now in use there.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while it is probable that many years will elapse
before tea-culture will engage the general attention of
farmers and planters in this country, still there is no good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>reason why it should be so. True, the profits of tea-culture
are as yet not clearly established, the management of
the plant and the proper application of the various processes
must be for many years, as in India and Ceylon,
of a purely experimental character, and even when seemingly
fair tests have been made failures will still occur, and
although these efforts may be traced to causes, which
persistent effort would eventually overcome, yet when
there is a large outlay and loss, accompanied with some
doubts of ultimate success, the efforts in most cases will
be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has been suggested that the United States Government
could, at a comparative small cost to it, materially
assist in determining and demonstrating the feasibility of
tea-culture in this country, finally solving the question of
profit. These questions could all be answered satisfactorily
and definitely in a very few years if our Government
were to secure say twenty acres of land in a
suitable locality and plant a portion of it yearly with tea
plants, until ten or more acres were planted. Then,
when the plants had become sufficiently matured, provide
a small laboratory fitted with the necessary modern
apparatus, placing it in the charge of a competent manager
who could make such experiments in the preparation
of the leaf as may be suggested by those interested
in the enterprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a special report of the Department of Agriculture
issued in 1877, we find the following extracts from letters
submitted by cultivators of the tea-plant in the United
States:—</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Thomas M. Cox, Greenville, S. C., says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>I obtained, in 1857, from the Patent Office, a box of tea-plants. I
gave the most of them away, and retained a few myself. They have
grown well without any protection, in the open air, and have attained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>a height of from 8 to 10 feet. They have frequently matured the
seed, and there are a number of the seed on the ground at this
time. They are an evergreen in this climate, and are now in
flower, with the seed of last year’s growth fully matured upon the
bush. I have never succeeded in making tea from the leaves, not
knowing the process of manipulating it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. J. J. Lucas, Society Hill, S. C., states:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The tea-plant has been grown successfully in this State, Georgia
and Louisiana; General Gillespie’s particularly thriving well. On
the Middletown place, Ashley river, near Charleston, tea-plants
are now growing for ornamental use only, and are 10 feet high.
A gentleman in Georgia obtained 441 pounds of tea from one acre
of land, which, at 50 cents a pound, would bring $220.50; while
our average yield of cotton is only about $15 per acre.<a id='tn260'></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Dr. Turner Wilson, Windsor, N. C., writes:—</p>

<p class='c017'>I have been raising tea since 1858, but without much cultivation.
My yard and garden are sandy soil, and the plants or bushes, without
any cultivation, are of slow growth. I plant the seed about the
1st of April, but they come up under the bushes very thick from the
fallen seed. Sometimes I throw a little dirt on the seed which I do
not pick up. I have several hundred plants under the bushes,
from 4 to 12 inches high, and about fifty in my front yard. I send
you a package of Green tea-leaves, blossoms, and a few seed in
capsules. I have no person that understands curing the leaves,
but will send a package of the dried leaves, as I term them. I
frequently drink a sample infusion of the leaves dried in the shade,
and though not so good as the Chinese preparation, yet I know
that I am drinking the <i>pure</i> tea, without any coloring matter.</p>

<p class='c015'>James H. Rion, Esq., Winsboro, S. C., says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>I have no experience in the making of tea, but can certify to the
adaptability of the soil and climate of my section to the growth of
the plant itself. In the fall of 1859, I received from the Patent
Office, Washington, a very tiny tea-plant, which I placed in my
flower-garden as a curiosity. It has grown well, has always been
free from any disease, has had full out-door exposure, and attained
its present height (5 feet 8 inches) in the year 1865. It is continually
producing healthy seedlings. This shows that the plant finds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>itself entirely <i>at home</i> where it is growing. There cannot be the
least doubt but that the tea-plant will flourish in South Carolina<a id='tn261a'></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. W. M. Ives, Jr., Lake City, Fla., suggests:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Tea cultivation might be made profitable here, but our people
do not pay enough attention to such objects as promise returns in
future years. The method of drying the leaves is a very simple
process. Many families already possess a number of tea-plants,
but they grow them simply for their beauty and novelty. It has
been proven that tea can be grown in Georgia as well as in Florida.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dr. A. W. Thornton, Portland, Ore., declares:—</p>

<p class='c017'>That the tea-plant is admirably suited to Northern California and
Southern Oregon I have no question; more especially as the light
on the coast is so abundantly charged with actinic rays, as shown
by the richness of the foliage and gorgeous tints of the fruits and
autumnal foliage, which supports the view that any plant, the active
principle of which is located in the leaves, would <i>prima facie</i> yield
a richer product where actinic rays are abundant (which are known
to have an important influence upon chlorophyl and leaf development)
than in less favored climes. Some years ago, Mr. Samuel
Brannan started the cultivation of tea at <a id='tn261b'></a>Calistoga, in Napa county,
California, but through some mismanagement at the outset the
crop did not succeed. But to this day solitary plants can be seen
in that locality, exhibiting vigorous growth, proving the suitability
of both soil and climate. Since that time a gentleman has started
a plantation of tea at <a id='tn261c'></a>Modesto, in the foot-hills of the Sierra Nevada
mountains, Stanislaus county, California, in which the plants have
done so well that from the last accounts he was so far encouraged
as to extend his plantation.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Arthur P. Ford, Charleston, S. C., says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>About four or five years ago I obtained from a friend some seeds
of the tea-plant, and planted them in my garden, twenty-one miles
from Charleston, inland. The plants came up readily, were duly
transplanted, and are now fine shrubs three feet high, and seven
in number. The foliage is luxuriant; and the plants bear the
coldest weather here without any ill effects, the mercury on more
than one occasion marking 16°, the plants being encased in ice at
other times also.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>William Summer, Esq., Newberry, S. C., states:—</p>

<p class='c017'>There are several healthy, vigorous tea-plants growing in Columbia.
I have seen, at the Greenville residence of the late Hon. J. R.
Poinsett, the tea-plants growing finely from those introduced by
Dr. Junius Smith. We have here also the <i>Olea fragrans</i>, with
which we can flavor the tea equal to any prepared for the special
use of the Emperor of China. The fragrant olive blooms freely
from early spring until midwinter, and the flowers, when gathered
fresh and put in the caddy among the tea, impart a delightful
aroma to the tea. I have, at different times, imported a few tea-plants
from <a id='tn262a'></a>Angers, France, and these have been disseminated
from the Pomaria nurseries, and found to succeed. So that I have
no doubt of the success of the tea-plant in the middle and upper
portions of this State.</p>

<p class='c015'>Col. S. D. Morgan, Nashville, Tenn., says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Of all the plants for the South Atlantic States that of the Chinese
or Japanese tea promises most success. Before the war I had a
few of the shrubs growing in a small parterre attached to my town
dwelling, from which I obtained leaves as rich in aroma and <i>theine</i>
as is to be found in tea from any country whatever. The shrub
grows luxuriantly in Central Georgia—even 100 miles north of
Augusta, to my personal knowledge—as I there used the domestic
article for several weeks’ time and found it excellent. There may,
however, be a difficulty about its culture, for want of a very cheap
class of laborers to pick and prepare the leaves. This, however,
is a subject I have not investigated, but I think it is worthy of a
thorough investigation.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Alex. M. Foster, Georgetown, S. C., says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The original plant I brought from Columbia. It is a genuine
<i>Thea <a id='tn262b'></a>Viridis</i> from seed, I think, produced from the tea-plants
brought to this State some years since by Dr. Junius Smith, and
cultivated near Greenville. After my plant had attained the height
of two or three feet, it began to bear flowers and seed. From
these seeds, or nuts, I have now 50 or 60 plants of various sizes;
some of them bearing fruit also. I might have had 500 plants as
50, so easily are they propagated and so abundantly do they bear
seed. The only care necessary is to preserve the tap-root as carefully
as may be in removing the young plants from the nursery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>bed. My plants are in a rich dry soil, and grow very rapidly,
requiring only three or four years to reach the height of 4 feet,
they are as thrifty and bear the vicissitudes of our climate as well
as the native Cassina. If there could be invented some machine
to imitate this hand labor, to effect the same slow process by means
less expensive than the man-hand, I think that the cultivation of
tea might become not only practical, but profitable to a large portion
of our Southern country.</p>

<p class='c015'>Rev. W. A. Meriwether, Columbia, S. C., says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>I obtained a Chinese tea-plant from North Carolina nine years
ago, and set it out in open ground in a plot of Bermuda grass. It
has received no cultivation, and is now a fine shrub, measuring to-day
six and a half feet in height by nine feet across the branches
at the base. The soil where it grows is light, sandy land, with no
clay within two feet of the surface. The plant is not affected by
the severest cold to which our climate is subject. It was not the
least injured by the intense cold of December, 1870, when my
thermometer registered 1° above zero; the coldest weather I have
ever known in this latitude. That the climate of the Southern
States is well suited to the cultivation of the tea-plant, I think
there can be no question. I sincerely hope you may succeed in
your efforts to arouse our people to the importance of its cultivation.
If only enough tea were made to supply the home demand,
what an immense annual saving would result.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hon. James Calhoun, Trotter’s Shoals, Savannah
River, S. C., says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Eighteen years ago some half-dozen tea-plants, brought from
China, were sent me. I set them in what had been a strawberry
bed, in a soil friable, of medium quality, unmanured. Nothing
had been done beyond keeping down the weeds with the hoe.
The plants have had no protection: but during a portion of the
first summer, seedlings have some shelter. As yet there has been
no damage from blight or from insects. Frequently leaves are
clipped in moderation from all parts of the bush, care being taken
not to denude it. They are parched in an iron vessel at the kitchen
fire, constantly stirred, and immediately afterward packed in air-tight
boxes. I enclose leaves plucked to-day, measuring from 3½
to 5 inches, and, as you will perceive, exhibiting three varieties.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Mrs. R. J. Screven, McIntosh, Liberty Co., Ga.,
says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>My experience is that the tea-plant does best in land somewhat
low, but not such as water will lie upon or is overflowed. I sow the
seed in the fall, as soon as they ripen and drop from the bushes, in
drills eighteen inches apart. They come up readily in the spring,
and by winter are from three to six inches high. Under the shade
of some large tree is usually the place selected for sowing the seed,
for if the plants are exposed to the hot sun while young, they
invariably die the first summer. When six months old they are
ready for transplanting; have generally a good supply of roots,
and can be set out at any time from the first of November to the
last of March. In putting them out, I have generally prepared
holes to receive them, to give a good start, so that fine, healthy
bushes will be obtained. In April, 1867, I think it was, Mr. Howard,
from Baltimore, who had been engaged on a plantation for several
years in the East, visited my father’s plantation in this country,
and expressed himself as surprised at the splendid growth of the
tea. Being there at the time of gathering the young leaves, he
plucked from one bush alone, prepared the tea himself, and took
it on to Baltimore, where he had it tested and weighed. He wrote
back that it had been pronounced stronger and of superior flavor
to the imported, and that by calculation he was satisfied that four
hundred and fifty pounds of cured tea could be made here at the
South to one acre of ground<a id='tn264'></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. J. W. Pearce, Fayetteville, N. C., writes:—</p>

<p class='c017'>My plants are now about five feet high, very thick and bushy
near the ground; have no protection from any kind of weather,
while the mercury has been as low as 10° below zero. They do not
seem to suffer from drought, as evergreens, and bear a beautiful
white flower, with little scent until nearly ready to fall. The seed
are like the hazel-nut; have a hard shell and bitter kernel, and take
a long time to germinate. Hence it is better to plant them on the
north side of a fence or house, where they will remain moist.
They come up readily when left under the bushes where they have
been dropped. The plants then can be set out successfully if care
be taken to avoid breaking the long tap root peculiar to them.
Half a dozen plants furnish my family, of five or six persons, with
more tea than we can use. We prepare it by heating the leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>in an oven until wilted, then squeeze them by hand until a juice is
expressed from them, then dry them again in the oven. The tea is
then quite fragrant and ready for use, improving with age.</p>

<p class='c015'>About 50 pounds of a fairly marketable article of
American tea has recently been produced by a Mr. Sheppard
of Summerfield, S. C., who grew and cured the
leaves in an ordinary fruit evaporator. On being tested,
the sample was pronounced equal to the average of China
Congous and much superior to many of the India, Java
and Ceylon growths. With other and more proper
methods of curing, the quality and character could
undoubtedly be much improved. Much more evidence
could be selected as to the quality of tea produced by
ordinary domestic processes, but it is sufficiently well
ascertained that it is within the capacity of hundreds of
thousands of people in this country to grow and prepare
all the tea they require, leaving the question of its
profitable commercial culture to be settled by practical
test later.</p>
